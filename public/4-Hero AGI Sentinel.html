                    <p>Magina wasn't nicknamed the Anti-Mage for no reason. His passive Mana Break attack allows him to deal extra damage and cripple a caster's mana supply. With a great understanding of the spiritual realm, he becomes more resilient against magical attacks using his Spell Shield, along with the ability to Blink across short distances for superb maneuverability. Seeking out weary casters, he uses Mana Void to inflict immense damage for high amounts of missing mana. Although he will be at a natural disadvantage to casters early on, as his powers grow, there is none better suited for bringing the greatest of spell casters down to their knees.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>Twin sons to the great Prophet, Terrorblade and Magina were blessed with divine powers: Terrorblade granted with an unnatural affinity with life forces; Magina gifted with energy manipulation. Magina's eventual overexposure to the magics gradually augmented his elemental resistances and bestowed him the unique ability to move faster than light itself. Now, broken by Terrorblade's fall to the dark side, Magina answers the Sentinel's call in a desperate bid to redeem his brother. Every bitter strike turns the Scourge's evil essences upon themselves, culminating in a finale that forces his enemy to awaken to the void within and spontaneously implode.</P>

                    <p>While relatively weak in close ranged combat, the Sniper can be deadly from a distance. With precision accuracy, Kardel frequently lands Headshots, momentarily disrupting and dealing heavier damage. He also can attack from the greatest distance having mastered aiming with his trusty rifle. Combine these two skills with the fact that bullets are unrivaled in projectile velocity, and it doesn't take long to realize his unparalleled last hitting capability. For dealing with large waves and heavier structures, Kardel fires Shrapnel that spreads out dealing damage and slowing in an area. He is renowned for his ultimate attack, Assassinating victims from an astounding distance with quite the punch behind it, using a specialized and costly ammunition round.</p>

                    <P>Kardel Sharpeye is a testament to his name and race. Using only his finely honed skills of marksmanship and his trusty rifle, he systematically destroys his opponents from afar. Taking great care to aim for the most vulnerable of areas, he is capable of severely injuring an opponent, and with a little extra time, has been known to simply dispose of an enemy in a single shot. His rifle is equipped with a secondary barrel, capable of launching a short burst of shrapnel at close range, causing massive damage.</P>

He will frequently slash at Critical points on the body to deal twice his damage, and can provide a Healing Ward in more tranquil times. The Juggernaut's ultimate attack is a fierce Omnislash, which slashes towards a target and then consecutively slashes at any targets within the area at random--extremely potent damage if concentrated, but potentially weak if dispersed amongst too many enemies.</p>

                    <p>The Lone Druid must command his trusted Spirit Bear with pinpoint and tactical orders just as well if not more so than his own actions. While the druid is fragile, his companion is the furthest thing from, and can keep him safe by being on a constant counter offensive. Becoming Rabid, they can gain a boost in their movement and attack speed, both useful for retreat and reentering a fight--a pattern the Lone Druid must master. The bear itself can equip items, and passively Entangle foes it attacks at times. The Druid can eventually metamorphose from his ranged, less durable state, into a melee, sturdier bear form.</p>

Sensing their settlement's impending destruction they turned their child into a bear and sent him into the wild. Syllabear grew up strong and savage, like the bears that inhabited the forests of his home. Using druidic powers, he can enter a state of almost rabid frenzy, and even call powerful bear companions to aid him. Awakened into his elven heritage by Furion the Prophet, Syllabear has regained his true elven form, and brings the bestial spirit of the bear to the battlefield.</P>

                    <p>Luna Moonfang may look and feel soft and tender, but she can deal great amounts of damage to both single and multiple foes. Her Lucent Beams inflict ample damage from high range early on, and her ultimate Eclipse fires multiple beams rapidly at random targets around her, making quick work of isolated opponents. Her glaive attacks passively bounce from one target to the next, allowing her to deal damage to a number of units, and can become extremely powerful if enough damage is acquired. She passively empowers herself and nearby allies with a Lucent Blessing, which also increases her night vision. The Moonrider needs to be kept down, and to bring her down one must approach with caution, precision or backup.</p>

She fights alongside the Sentinel in the never-ending battle to cleanse the land of the unholy Scourge. Through her valiant efforts, she has been granted small portions of Elune's mystical power. Luna uses this gift to cut a swath through her enemies. It has been said that Luna is able to call down the very light of the moon, and is always surrounded by a glowing aura, as though in moonlight herself. Luna is a shining beacon for the Sentinel, an ever vigilant protector.</P>

                    <p>The Morphling is a dynamic hero, capable of giving or taking massive amounts of damage, at the will of the player. His Waveform allows him to escape or initiate fights with ease, while his Adaptive Strike gives him a versatile, powerful nuke or stun. His Replicate allows him to make a copy of a hero, and to take the place of the copy in an instant. Morphling's greatest strength, however, is his ability to transfer his agility points to strength, and vice-versa, allowing him to take on the role of tank or damagedealer at a moment's notice. The Morphling is a dangerously mobile enemy, who must be treated with caution before he takes you by surprise!</p>

                    <P>The Morphling, nature's magnum opus, the pinnacle of evolution, can force his liquid body to flow over opponents in a massive wave, forcibly moving himself as well as injuring his enemies. At a whim he may change the composition of his body, trading strength for agility and vice versa. Capable of manipulating his energy into either disable or damage based on his strongest attribute, the Morphling's most disturbing ability creates a literal clone of a chosen target, forcing them to face their own reflection as he crushes them in their confusion.</P>

                    <p>Naga Siren has a handy net that can pin down a target for long durations, but they are still able to attack and cast so it's best not to underestimate them as helpless. This is why Slithice uses Mirror Images to both confuse and outnumber her disabled enemies, each able to consistently land Critical Strikes. The Siren's Song has been known to put to sleep even the greatest of warriors at an instant, from long ranges, and for lengthy durations. This ability allows her to get out of trouble rather easily, or setup her own. It also provides a window of opportunity to take down structures, as sleeping guards have never proven useful.</p>

                    <P>Slithice was always a vagabond among the Naga, roaming beyond the boundaries of the sea in search of new things. During her adventures she met and fell in love with a young Orc training to be a Blademaster. Though he was inexperienced he taught her many Orcish fighting tactics employed by seasoned warriors. During their courtship as she was learning how to make traps from a local raider, a swarm of Scourge came and invaded, and her love was killed before her very eyes. She used her Naga magics to put the evil to sleep and fled, and now gives her all to the Sentinel, in the name of her love.</P>

                    <p>The Phantom Lancer causes chaos and confusion by creating weaker clones of himself. All of his abilities allow him to summon more illusions. His Spirit Lance deals damage and slows an enemy, while also spawning an image at the target. Doppelwalk renders the Lancer invisible, but an image is immediately created to hide the fact that he disappeared. Juxtapose grants a chance to summon an image whenever he attacks, while Phantom Edge grants images a chance to do the same along with providing him and his copies spell resistance. These illusions make Azwraith a fearsome enemy, and a devastating pusher.</p>

                    <P>Although his true name is unknown to his allies, Azwraith's assigned name tells you enough. Like the Angel of Death, Azrael, he fights to rid the world of those who choose to embrace undeath. He is able to appear and disappear at will like a wraith, often appearing in many places at once. Azwraith is more than capable of dispatching the undead using his lance, each blow sending them closer to the spirit-realm. This lance is the source of his astounding ability to duplicate himself; whenever it draws blood he can use their life to create weaker copies of himself.</P>

Mirana can also Leap small distances to escape or chase, and when she touches down, allies in the area are enchanted with movement speed. Her ultimate Moonlight Shadow enables her to briefly render her entire team invisible, for a group surprise attack or retreat. While always hard to catch, Mirana is most deadly and feared when keeping her own prey from fleeing.</p>

In times of need however, she can fade herself and others around her into the safety of invisibility, making her a potent supporter matched by few.

He could be anywhere, at any time, and therein lies his strength. His preferred attack is obviously to Backstab someone, inflicting greater damage as he grows more agile. He can also Blink Strike towards his enemies to quickly get in range of attack, making it even harder to escape or catch him. Once he decides to reveal himself, Rikimaru can unleash a Smoke Screen in a moderate area, which gradually expands, silencing anyone inside, slowing them down, and causing them to miss. Only a fool would continue fighting while blind, deaf and dumb, but Assassins have no room for remorse.</p>

However, the power of the Burning Legion managed to corrupt many of his kind, leaving them as mindless beasts in the forest. Vowing revenge against the Scourge, he sharpened his skills for battle. Using his small size to his advantage, he can render himself invisible, enabling him to stab his enemies in the back. He can also use thick smoke as a cover, to silence his enemies and become nearly untouchable.</P>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Troll Warlord is a pure fighter, able to attack from a distance or up close, where he becomes stronger overall and may also bash. He capitalizes on attack speed, being able to strike and move quickly, as well as enhance his allies to sometimes do the same. Jah'rakal can also Blind his opponents, making it difficult for them to land attacks. Additionally, successive attacks landed on a target enable greater focus for Jah'rakal, greatly increasing his attack speed. If he is able to acquire items and momentum soon enough, there aren't many fighters who can best him.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>When the Sentinel first gathered their forces, The Troll Warriors were considered primitive and unreliable. Their pride wounded, many refused to join, some even considering siding with the Scourge. Only a hotheaded young Warlord called Jah'rakal joined the Sentinel. Known as "Blinding Axe" in troll tongue, both for the blinding speed of his axes and his trademark blind technique, his unstoppable rampages have already made him a legend among his allies. However Jah'rakal fights not for the Sentinel, or even to defend the Ancients, but to show Elves, Men, Orcs and anyone else that trolls are the best fighters in the world.</P>

                    <p>The Gyrocopter is a hero who is focused on dealing damage, but also got some potential to disable or slow enemies. His array of very different offensive spells gives him the ability to deal a lot of damage in any situation, which makes him a strong laner, but also a potential carry. Rocket Barrage, his first skill, shoots rockets at random targets around Gyrocopter, which makes it an exceptionally strong ability against lone enemies. With the low cooldown, short duration but high attack frequency it can easily decimate an enemy's HP in the early stage of the game... if you manage to stay in range.</p>

                    <P>Raised amongst the dwarven mining clan, Aurel grew up with a fascination for making things explode. Such tendencies were considered healthy in the mining society as a dwarf's skill with explosives determined his pay, his rank and of course, his popularity amongst the females. Unlike the rest of the clan however, Aurel sought to use his skills for more than just blowing up rocks. By combining controlled detonations with thick metal to direct their force, Aurel is able to create everything from engines to missiles. Excited to be able to put his inventions to the test, Aurel's presence on the battlefield promises to be a blast!

She can provide constant support with her Frost Arrows to keep enemies pinned, Silence them so they can't retaliate with spells once they're forced to fight, and deal nice damage with her passive Trueshot Aura and Marksmanship abilities, which capitalize on and offer agility respectively. A good Archer will keep their distance, kiting an enemy in constant barrage, never letting them get dangerously close, and Traxex can achieve just that.</p>

As a part of her resolution, she joined the Sentinel, bringing her excellent marksmanship to the fray. Some of her abilities include stripping magical beings of their voices, and enchanting her arrows with an icy cold. While such powers are valuable, her true origin will never cease to linger around in the judging eyes of others.</P>

She can Meld into the shadows at any time, but must remain still to keep hidden. If she strikes from the shadows, she will deal additional damage and lower her target's armor. The Templar Assassin's Psi Blades can be thrown from moderate range, and actually pierce her targets to deal damage further in a line. Her ability to place Psionic Traps from great distances, which slow nearby targets on activation, makes her nearly impossible to escape from. While she is able to create a number of disadvantages for her opponents, if caught with her guard down she will quickly fall.</p>

And so more often than not, the foes that encounter the Templar on the battlefield find themselves dead and buried, their lives cut short as she fades back into the shadows, waiting for a new prey.</P>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Bounty Hunters like Gondar do not play by the rules. His ideal attack pattern is to initiate from the shadows and stab you in the back. He'll keep this up if unchecked, and carries deadly Shurikens to deal high ranged damage as well. He also learns Jinada, which allows him to deal critical damage while slowing his prey down, allowing his strength to match his cunning later on. What sets him aside from any other killer, however, is that he doesn't work for free. Gondar can Track his targets, monitoring their location, making them easier to chase, and providing a hefty gold reward if the poor sap winds up dead--which he makes often the case.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>Gondar is a Draenei that is often called upon for his superior skills. Not much is known about his past, but his capabilities are extraordinary. Some believe he learned from a ninja clan while others say he was born with his amazing abilities. He is able to throw shurikens with extreme accuracy and has the strength to strike down any foe with his two swift blades. His agility is matched by none, and his stealth is inferior only to few. He is interested in the conflict for money alone, and is promised a large reward.</P>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Xin is one of the few Agility heroes equipped to initiating roles in team fights and skirmishes. Using Fire Remnants' high mobility and Searing Chains for AOE disable, Xin is well suited for aggressive play style in both early and mid game, provided you have the manapool for it. Flame Guard offers some protection on magic damage, but don't expect it to save you from chain nukes or disables. Sleight of Fist is a mini version of Juggernaut's Omnislash that extends Xin's carry role into late game, not to mention invulnerability every 6 seconds.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>In sword forging furnaces of war, something powerful was taking shape. In a desperate bid to make superior weapons a sword smith by the name of Xin captured and bound a fire spirit to his forge. After countless hours of toil, a single pair of swords were born of the enchanted furnace. While holding and admiring the mystical blades the fire spirit was able to pass into Xin's body creating a being born of flesh and flame. Xin became more powerful than the soldiers he was tasked to outfit, and march out himself to dispatch the enemies of warmth and life. Equipped with burning steel and blazing speed, Xin tears through his enemies leaving nothing but a cinder.</P>
