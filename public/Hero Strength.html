                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Daelin Proudmoore is a fearsome opponent in nearly any situation. His passive ability, Tidebringer, causes his sword to splash out massive damage over an area when he attacks, making him not only a constant threat in the lane, but a excellent damage dealer later in the game. Through the deadly combination of X Marks the Spot and Torrent, he can also pick off his fleeing enemies at will. He's not at a loss in large team clashes either; His ultimate summons the legendary ship S.S. CoCo, which empowers his allies with rum and crashes into enemies, causing massive devastation. This ruthless admiral leaves none alive, least not dry!</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Of all the allies in the Sentinel's ranks, only one, is known by as many names and is feared in as many lands. Called Capt. CoCo by his mates, Jacksparrow by others, The Legendary Mariner by some, but only a select few know his real name and what it stands for. He can harness the powers of the depths to conjure torrential geysers that blast his enemies into the air. His elegant blade is sworn to the Seas and with each mighty swing it ebbs like the tides. Using a watery form of spacial magic, he can bring you back to your original destination. The Captain now sails towards the Scourge lands, aboard his Phantom vessel boosting the spirits of his comrades with his fabled Rum, paving the way for the victory of the Sentinel. He is Kunkka, Master and Commander of the seven seas.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Beastmaster is a very well-rounded fighter, with many tactical options available for all types of combat. Although his physical attacks are melee, he can throw his axes at long range to slice through enemies, dealing lethal damage. His Primal Roar can turn the most organized defense into chaos, allowing the Beastmaster and his allies to move in for the kill. His summoning skills serve as effective support for his blitz-style combat. Rexxar's agile Hawk flies above the battlefield scouting for enemies, and the powerful slowing abilities of his Quillbeast's spines give him time to finish off fleeing foes. A skilled Beastmaster is a deadly foe, capable of fighting any enemy on any terms and crushing them to a pulp.</p>

                    <p>A wandering vagrant of the Mok'nathal, the fabled half orc-half ogres of legend, Rexxar and his mighty blades have joined the cause of the Sentinel to better protect the natural world around him. A friend of beasts, Rexxar flails and tears at his enemies with unsettling savagery, even going as far as hurling his axes in the manner of boomerangs at his enemies to better his chances at victory. Truly a warrior of the living planet that thrives around him, the Beastmaster is an ally to be counted on when he is needed the most.</p>

                    <p>The Centaur Warchief's toughness and survivability are legendary. The best place for this tank of a hero is in the center of combat, where his close range skills and massive vitality can be put to use. The Warchief's Hoof Stomp can incapacitate any enemies foolish enough to go toe-to-toe with him for several crucial seconds, giving the Warchief and his allies time to finish them off. The Warchief can also deliver a single lethal blow at the cost of some of his own life with Double Edge. In addition, the Warchief's passive Return skill deals damage to attackers, making bringing this beast down a difficult and risky proposition at best. His charismatic leadership can rally ally forces to race across the toughest terrains, leaving his trampled enemies sluggish in its wake.</p>

                    <p>Gifted with a tremendous body and an ever-growing fortitude, Bradwarden's courage is only matched by the size of his heart. Prophesied as a savior by the oracles of his tribe, Bradwarden is the living token of the allegiance of the centaurs to the Sentinel. He swings his axe with massive force, sometimes even hurting himself when doing so. The ground trembles every time he slams his hoof and his reflexes are impossible to surpass; allowing him to retaliate just after being attacked. Bradwarden is decided to fulfill his destiny, and he knows that the upcoming battle will become his ultimate challenge.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Although the Earthshaker is a strength hero, his real power lies in his spells. With a well-placed Echo Slam, Raigor can single-handedly level an entire team of enemies if they are foolish enough to bunch together. His Fissure spell is very versatile. While it deals decent damage along with a stun, it also creates an impassible wall of rock for several seconds. A skilled Earthshaker can use this to his advantage, blocking enemy movement and trapping hapless foes between a rock and a hard place. Enchant Totem gives him a significant damage boost for one attack, and his passive Aftershock ability causes a minor stun and damage effect under him every time he casts one of his spells. Although he is one of the more difficult heroes to use to his full strength, he is also one of the most deadly heroes in skilled hands.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>In the barren-lands, tales spoke of tauren sages reaping the essence of dirt. Their consciousness melds with the brown beneath them. The loam becomes the conduit of their mental thought and reality. These warriors were feared for they could summon massive ruptures at their mere whim. So tremendous was their power that their magic leaks out of the earth violently with every spell. Sadly these sages mysteriously faded from the land. When the World Tree was threatened, couriers searched for these mighty ones but found just one. A young adept, Raigor Stonehoof, seeks battle to weave new tales of these shamans.</p>

                    <p>A noble hero through and through, the Omniknight uses his powerful support and healing abilities to turn the tide of battle. Purification, a direct healing spell, instantly heals a large portion of the targets life. However, it doubles as a powerful offensive ability, dealing massive damage to all foes surrounding the target being healed. Repel allows the Omniknight to make a target ally immune to most spells for an extended period of time, although it makes them unable to be targeted by Purification. Enemies who try to escape Purist's holy wrath will find it difficult to flee from his Degeneration Aura, which passively slows the movement of all nearby foes. Finally, his Guardian Angel can single-handedly turn the tide of any battle. This powerful protective spell grants all allies within range near-invulnerability to physical damage, as well as rapid healing. His peerless support skills in the heat of battle make the Omniknight an invaluable member of any team.</p>

Trained by Uther himself in the ways of the Paladin, Purist brings the power of the Holy Light to the battlefield. He can purify the souls of allies, harming any nearby Scourge in the process. Able to protect allies from harmful unholy magic, the mere presence of a man of the Holy Light atrophies any nearby enemies. In times of dire need, Purist can call upon God himself to protect him and his allies.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Brewmaster uses the ancient art of drunken fighting to bash his enemies to a bloody pulp while surviving even the most deadly attacks with ease. Thunder Clap deals a lot of damage to nearby enemies while slowing them significantly, giving the Brewmaster time to bash their skulls in with his drunken brawling skills. If an enemy seems too dangerous the Brewmaster douses them with Drunken Haze, which causes the majority of the target's physical attacks to miss their mark. Heroes who rely on physical attacks will find the Brewmaster nearly impossible to damage when he uses Drunken Haze and Drunken Brawler. In addition, even if the Brewmaster does seem to be in danger, he can split into three powerful elemental aspects with Primal Split. Each individual elemental panda is a dangerous fighter with their own unique abilities. The Brewmaster is a difficult enemy to defeat, and should be engaged only with overwhelming force.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Mangix originates from a deeply hidden and secret society located on the obscure island of Pandaria. He lived a sheltered life in his home within the Stonetalon Mountains, but even the far, golden reaches of Pandaria were affected by the dark hand of the Scourge. The elders heard the cries of the innocent, and saw the blood of the slain, and so, they agreed to send one elite warrior, hoping to turn the tides of battle and restore the Great Balance. What they did not know was that the local barkeep had trained for this very moment his entire life.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Sven is all about getting pumped up. His skills allow him to deal a lot of area of effect damage to several targets at once. Storm Bolt is a powerful damage spell, which stuns both the target and all surrounding units for several seconds, allowing Sven to catch up and deal with them. His Warcry ability helps, giving Sven and nearby allies a temporary movement speed and armor bonus so they can charge quickly and fearlessly. Sven's foes should be especially fearful of his powerful physical attacks. God's Strength pumps Sven's damage up to very high levels, and Cleave turns every attack into an area of effect strike. Although his gameplay is fairly straightforward, Sven should not be underestimated. The best course of action when faced with a fully pumped Sven is to run.</p>

He has come out of his wanderings determined to guard the innocent against evil.

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Although his name seems fitting at first, over time Tiny the Stone Giant will grow both in size and strength. His immense strength allows him to grab the closest enemy and toss them through the air towards a target unit. Combining this with Tiny's Avalanche spell gives him incredible area of effect damage. However, Tiny is also extremely dangerous in one on one situations. With proper timing Tiny can Toss an enemy who is taking damage from Avalanche, and if the target lands back in the Avalanche they will take double damage. This is often enough to instantly kill more fragile heroes, although tougher heroes should be wary of engaging the Stone Giant as well. Tiny's Craggy Exterior can occasionally stun close range attackers, giving him time to escape or punish them with his crushing blows. If possible, it's best to keep this mobile mountain at arm's length.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Looming from the rocky crags of Ashenra, the stone giants are born from the mountain itself. Tiny, a newly born giant, although small in size, has the strength of a hill. With his supreme strength, he is able to launch anything into the air, including huge amounts of soil to cause avalanches around his enemies. Because of his craggy exterior, enemies have a hard time attacking him. Over time, Tiny's body will grow bigger as the magnetic forces deep inside his granite heart pull rocks and soil to his rugged stone form.</p>
