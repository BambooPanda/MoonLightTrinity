                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Daelin Proudmoore is a fearsome opponent in nearly any situation. His passive ability, Tidebringer, causes his sword to splash out massive damage over an area when he attacks, making him not only a constant threat in the lane, but a excellent damage dealer later in the game. Through the deadly combination of X Marks the Spot and Torrent, he can also pick off his fleeing enemies at will. He's not at a loss in large team clashes either; His ultimate summons the legendary ship S.S. CoCo, which empowers his allies with rum and crashes into enemies, causing massive devastation. This ruthless admiral leaves none alive, least not dry!</p>

                	<h3>BACKGROUND STORY</h3>
                    <p>Of all the allies in the Sentinel's ranks, only one, is known by as many names and is feared in as many lands. Called Capt. CoCo by his mates, Jacksparrow by others, The Legendary Mariner by some, but only a select few know his real name and what it stands for. He can harness the powers of the depths to conjure torrential geysers that blast his enemies into the air. His elegant blade is sworn to the Seas and with each mighty swing it ebbs like the tides. Using a watery form of spacial magic, he can bring you back to your original destination. The Captain now sails towards the Scourge lands, aboard his Phantom vessel boosting the spirits of his comrades with his fabled Rum, paving the way for the victory of the Sentinel. He is Kunkka, Master and Commander of the seven seas.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Centaur Warchief's toughness and survivability are legendary. The best place for this tank of a hero is in the center of combat, where his close range skills and massive vitality can be put to use. The Warchief's Hoof Stomp can incapacitate any enemies foolish enough to go toe-to-toe with him for several crucial seconds, giving the Warchief and his allies time to finish them off. The Warchief can also deliver a single lethal blow at the cost of some of his own life with Double Edge. In addition, the Warchief's passive Return skill deals damage to attackers, making bringing this beast down a difficult and risky proposition at best. His charismatic leadership can rally ally forces to race across the toughest terrains, leaving his trampled enemies sluggish in its wake.</p>

                    <p>Gifted with a tremendous body and an ever-growing fortitude, Bradwarden's courage is only matched by the size of his heart. Prophesied as a savior by the oracles of his tribe, Bradwarden is the living token of the allegiance of the centaurs to the Sentinel. He swings his axe with massive force, sometimes even hurting himself when doing so. The ground trembles every time he slams his hoof and his reflexes are impossible to surpass; allowing him to retaliate just after being attacked. Bradwarden is decided to fulfill his destiny, and he knows that the upcoming battle will become his ultimate challenge.</p>
