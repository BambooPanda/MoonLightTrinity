                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Crystal Maiden is a powerful disabler and support spellcaster. Each of her offensive spells impairs the target in some way, making her a valuable addition to any lineup. Crystal Nova allows her to blast multiple enemies with chilling damage, and Frostbite completely stops a single target enemy from moving for several seconds. Freezing Field causes immense damage and slows everything in a large area around Rylai, but her natural fragility makes it a difficult spell to use to its full effect. Despite the usefulness of all of her spells to her allies, perhaps her greatest asset to her team is Brilliance Aura. This aura gives all allies across the map a significant boost to their mana regeneration, giving them plenty of energy to use their own spells no matter where they are. Although she tends to take on a supportive role, the Crystal Maiden is still one of the most valuable heroes for any team.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Adept in the manipulation of frost and ice, Rylai is the very image of elegeance and grace. Trained by a renegade wizard deep in the heart of Winterspring, Rylai brings to the Sentinel her prowess in the arts of magic. With a vast arsenal of spells, she wreaks havoc upon her foes - be it with powerful blasts of frost to send them fleeing in panic, or be it by rendering them immobile in ice. Her foes tremble in fear as the ground beneath implodes in mighty novas of frost in a dazzling array, obliterating all who dare oppose her</p>

                    <p>Although all Dryads are Cenarius' daughters, Aiushtha is said to be his first and favorite. Because of her direct relation to him, she has borrowed much of his power. This is demonstrated by her control over the shy Wisps which she uses to heal her allies, and her ability to bring an opponent under the will of the Sentinel. Preferring ranged combat to melee, she fashioned a spear that strikes with more force the further her target is away. Her agility is unmatched, and any opponent attempting to kill her will find she skips ahead of them with surprising ease.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Loved by aggressive players everywhere, Puck the Fairie Dragon is one of the best heroes in the game at starting fights. Puck's skills are useful in any situation, giving him a lot of flexibility and making him a great hero in both support and offensive roles. His signatue skill, Illusory Orb, is an example of this. Although it functions like a regular line damage spell, at any time during its course Puck can use his Ethereal Jaunt skill and instantly teleport to the position of the Illusory Orb. This makes the spell useful in both attacking and escaping. It also works perfectly with his second offensive spell, Waning Rift. Waning Rift deals damage and silences in an area around Puck, making it the natural choice for use after an Illusory Orb and Ethereal Jaunt. Puck's final offensive spell, Dream Coil, can be used either before or after this combo with great effect. Dream Coil traps enemies in a small area, forcing them to remain near the target point or take damage and get stunned. To complement his need to get up into his target's face, Puck has Phase Shift to help in sticky situations. Phase Shift renders Puck invulnerable for several seconds, although he is unable to move in this state. Puck is a relatively easy hero to pick up, but a rewarding one to master.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>In Sentinel's search for heroes to aid them in the war against the Scourge, they discovered the lost lands of the mystical Faerie Dragons. Upon explaining the conflict to the Faerie Queen of Agrace, she sent forth Puck, a personal guardian, to turn the tides of war. Despite his small size and mischievous personality, the little dragon soon proved to pack more than his fair share of power on the battlefield, blasting through the enemy ranks with balls of magic, faerie dust, and the capability to stupefy an entire army with nothing more than his imagination. His foes all learned the hard way that size matters not in combat, and that appearances are, ultimately, deceiving.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Chen's standard gameplay is different than most other heroes. His Holy Persuasion skill allows him to convert creeps to his side, including powerful neutral creeps such as the Centaur or Furbolg. As a result, Chen is usually found in the forest searching for creeps to convert. When he finds a strong creep or two, he descends on his unwary enemies, using both his own spells and the abilities of his persuaded creeps to take them out. Due to the difficulty of effectively controlling multiple units and abilities, Chen can be a tricky hero to play to his full potential. When ambushing an enemy hero, Chen generally uses his Penitence ability, which slows the target and causes them to take extra damage from Chen and his allies. The Holy Knight can use Test of Faith to finish off enemies, but it also doubles as a way to save allies who are in danger. Casting Test of Faith on an ally will teleport them to safety after a short time. Chen's support skills are rounded out by Hand of God, a healing spell which instantly restores a set amount of life to all allied heroes across the battlefield. Although Chen can be difficult for newer players, users with experience controlling multiple units effectively will find him very powerful.</p>

                    <p>The Keeper of the Light is a one man support team. He has a wide variety of support spells for any situation. He is a master of manipulating mana, with Chakra Magic to restore large amounts of energy to his allies and Mana Leak to drain it from his foes. Illuminate turns the Keeper of the Light into a piece of artillery. After a long charge up time, Illuminate releases a massive shockwave of energy, dealing huge amounts of damage to all enemies in its path. Due to its long channeling period, this spell is generally most effective in large offensive or defensive pushes. Spirit Form further elevates the support skills of the Keeper. While in Spirit Form, he no longer needs to be present to channel Illuminate; a spirit charges it for him, allowing him to move freely and cast other spells. He also gains the valuable Recall and Blinding Light spells while transformed. Recall can teleport any allied hero to his location from anywhere on the battlefield, and Blinding Light releases a massive pulse of light which knocks enemies away and causes them to miss most of their attacks for a few seconds afterwards. For support-minded players, it's tough to find a better hero.</p>

                    <p>Master of light and mana manipulation, Ezalor was once viewed as a scholar, and was regarded as a powerful mentor to many. However, his defection and betrayal of his allies during the War of the Magi caused him to be sentenced to banishment to the spirit realm for all of eternity. However, knowing of his tremendous power, the Sentinel granted him a corporeal form within the physical realm in exchange for his alliance against the Scourge onslaught.

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Zeus has one role: offensive spellcaster. His spell damage output is probably the highest of any hero in the game, due to the great damage and low cooldown periods of his spells. Arc Lightning strikes a large number of enemies with a relatively low damage chain lightning, but due to its low cost and cooldown it can be cast a large number of times during a battle. Lightning Bolt is easy to understand: lots of damage! Compared to a lot of other offensive spells, Lightning Bolt's damage, cooldown, and mana cost are very good, and it is Zeus' primary means for dealing with enemy heroes. Although Zeus has a passive skill, it is in fact another way to blast his enemies with even more spell damage. Every time Zeus casts a spell, Static Field shocks nearby enemy heroes for a small percentage of their life. This means Zeus will continue to deal good damage throughout the game as enemy heroes get higher and higher life. Perhaps Zeus' most feared ability is Thundergod's Wrath. When cast, this spell causes a bolt of lightning to strike all enemy heroes on the battlefield. This spell is especially useful for finishing off nearly dead heroes who are fleeing from battle, but it is also useful to give Zeus and his allies an edge in team fights.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Once a deity of unfathomable might, Zeus reluctantly sacrificed his much relished immortality in exchange for the chance to crush the sinister armies of the unholy undead. As his soul crossed into the mortal plane, his omnipotent powers withered greatly, yet not nearly enough to quell this destructive Thunder God's resolve for justice. With sheer precision, he cleanses through the enemy ranks with an impressive mastery of electrical discharge, smiting the fool hardy with formidable bolts of lightning from the heavens above. Ever vigilant in his relentless assault, the Scourge cowers in fear of incurring the fearsome wrath of the Lord of Olympia.</p>
