                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>If you need someone to support a single ally, there's no one better at doing that than Io, the Wisp. Tether is the core skill of this hero. It links him to an ally, increasing the movespeed of both his ally and himself and slowing anyone who touches the link, making it a perfect ganking tool. Since Io pulls himself to the tethered ally if the distance is high enough, it also doubles as a great escape skill. Besides, the skill is also useful after ganks, because it allows Wisp to transfer any regeneration he receives to his ally as well. With Spirits, Wisp has a long ranged damage skill that also serves the purpose of giving vision of enemies it hits. Overcharge's utility lies in its combo with Tether. At the cost of a percentage of Wisp's current HP and MP, it gives Wisp and his tethered ally increased attack speed and reduces the damage they receive, which effectively allows carries to do their job earlier in the game. But his true power lies in the synergy between Tether and his ultimate, Relocate. These two skills can turn any ally into a global ganking machine. Io and the tethered ally can teleport anywhere on the map for a short time. This is why Io is the only true global ganking support and it makes him very effective with allied carries that have killing power in the early-mid-game.</p>

                	<h3>BACKGROUND STORY</h3>
                    <p>Originally nothing more than a lowly spirit of the trees, Io dwelt peacefully amongst his kind in the Great Forest. As the Great War spread across the land the creatures of the forest were forced to defend their home. The desire to protect his kin awoke power in Io he had not known he possessed. He discovered he was able to connect his life force to another creature to strengthen them or help them flee by instantly transporting them out of harm. Io became known amongst his people as the Guardian Wisp, a protector of the Spirits. All other spirits swore to assist him and can be summoned to his side to aid him in his battle. Uninterested in the battle between the Sentinel and the Scourge, Io fights only to protect his people.</p>
