                    <p>Magina wasn't nicknamed the Anti-Mage for no reason. His passive Mana Break attack allows him to deal extra damage and cripple a caster's mana supply. With a great understanding of the spiritual realm, he becomes more resilient against magical attacks using his Spell Shield, along with the ability to Blink across short distances for superb maneuverability. Seeking out weary casters, he uses Mana Void to inflict immense damage for high amounts of missing mana. Although he will be at a natural disadvantage to casters early on, as his powers grow, there is none better suited for bringing the greatest of spell casters down to their knees.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>Twin sons to the great Prophet, Terrorblade and Magina were blessed with divine powers: Terrorblade granted with an unnatural affinity with life forces; Magina gifted with energy manipulation. Magina's eventual overexposure to the magics gradually augmented his elemental resistances and bestowed him the unique ability to move faster than light itself. Now, broken by Terrorblade's fall to the dark side, Magina answers the Sentinel's call in a desperate bid to redeem his brother. Every bitter strike turns the Scourge's evil essences upon themselves, culminating in a finale that forces his enemy to awaken to the void within and spontaneously implode.</P>

                    <p>While relatively weak in close ranged combat, the Sniper can be deadly from a distance. With precision accuracy, Kardel frequently lands Headshots, momentarily disrupting and dealing heavier damage. He also can attack from the greatest distance having mastered aiming with his trusty rifle. Combine these two skills with the fact that bullets are unrivaled in projectile velocity, and it doesn't take long to realize his unparalleled last hitting capability. For dealing with large waves and heavier structures, Kardel fires Shrapnel that spreads out dealing damage and slowing in an area. He is renowned for his ultimate attack, Assassinating victims from an astounding distance with quite the punch behind it, using a specialized and costly ammunition round.</p>

                    <P>Kardel Sharpeye is a testament to his name and race. Using only his finely honed skills of marksmanship and his trusty rifle, he systematically destroys his opponents from afar. Taking great care to aim for the most vulnerable of areas, he is capable of severely injuring an opponent, and with a little extra time, has been known to simply dispose of an enemy in a single shot. His rifle is equipped with a secondary barrel, capable of launching a short burst of shrapnel at close range, causing massive damage.</P>

He will frequently slash at Critical points on the body to deal twice his damage, and can provide a Healing Ward in more tranquil times. The Juggernaut's ultimate attack is a fierce Omnislash, which slashes towards a target and then consecutively slashes at any targets within the area at random--extremely potent damage if concentrated, but potentially weak if dispersed amongst too many enemies.</p>

                    <p>The Lone Druid must command his trusted Spirit Bear with pinpoint and tactical orders just as well if not more so than his own actions. While the druid is fragile, his companion is the furthest thing from, and can keep him safe by being on a constant counter offensive. Becoming Rabid, they can gain a boost in their movement and attack speed, both useful for retreat and reentering a fight--a pattern the Lone Druid must master. The bear itself can equip items, and passively Entangle foes it attacks at times. The Druid can eventually metamorphose from his ranged, less durable state, into a melee, sturdier bear form.</p>

Sensing their settlement's impending destruction they turned their child into a bear and sent him into the wild. Syllabear grew up strong and savage, like the bears that inhabited the forests of his home. Using druidic powers, he can enter a state of almost rabid frenzy, and even call powerful bear companions to aid him. Awakened into his elven heritage by Furion the Prophet, Syllabear has regained his true elven form, and brings the bestial spirit of the bear to the battlefield.</P>

                    <p>Luna Moonfang may look and feel soft and tender, but she can deal great amounts of damage to both single and multiple foes. Her Lucent Beams inflict ample damage from high range early on, and her ultimate Eclipse fires multiple beams rapidly at random targets around her, making quick work of isolated opponents. Her glaive attacks passively bounce from one target to the next, allowing her to deal damage to a number of units, and can become extremely powerful if enough damage is acquired. She passively empowers herself and nearby allies with a Lucent Blessing, which also increases her night vision. The Moonrider needs to be kept down, and to bring her down one must approach with caution, precision or backup.</p>

She fights alongside the Sentinel in the never-ending battle to cleanse the land of the unholy Scourge. Through her valiant efforts, she has been granted small portions of Elune's mystical power. Luna uses this gift to cut a swath through her enemies. It has been said that Luna is able to call down the very light of the moon, and is always surrounded by a glowing aura, as though in moonlight herself. Luna is a shining beacon for the Sentinel, an ever vigilant protector.</P>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Morphling is a dynamic hero, capable of giving or taking massive amounts of damage, at the will of the player. His Waveform allows him to escape or initiate fights with ease, while his Adaptive Strike gives him a versatile, powerful nuke or stun. His Replicate allows him to make a copy of a hero, and to take the place of the copy in an instant. Morphling's greatest strength, however, is his ability to transfer his agility points to strength, and vice-versa, allowing him to take on the role of tank or damagedealer at a moment's notice. The Morphling is a dangerously mobile enemy, who must be treated with caution before he takes you by surprise!</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>The Morphling, nature's magnum opus, the pinnacle of evolution, can force his liquid body to flow over opponents in a massive wave, forcibly moving himself as well as injuring his enemies. At a whim he may change the composition of his body, trading strength for agility and vice versa. Capable of manipulating his energy into either disable or damage based on his strongest attribute, the Morphling's most disturbing ability creates a literal clone of a chosen target, forcing them to face their own reflection as he crushes them in their confusion.</P>
