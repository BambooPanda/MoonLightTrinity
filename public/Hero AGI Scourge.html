                    <p>Imbued with shamanistic and demonic powers, Strygwyr is able to replenish his health with the lives he takes, as well as sense weakened souls which allow him to go into a blood frenzy, increasing his movement speed so he can chase down the enemy; if the hunted attempts to escape, Strygwyr will curse him to lose health if he moves. Up close and personal, the Bloodseeker can empower himself to almost double his damage, becoming on par even with the toughest fighters.</p>

                    <P>An unusual hybrid of Demon and Orc, Strygwyr is an outcast amongst all mortal creatures. By thriving on and bathing himself with the blood of those he slays, Strygwyr can heal his wounds - even those that could prove fatal. Beware the fool who dares venturing alone, for Strygwyr can sense his blood miles away and gain vision through his helpless prey's eyes. Having ruptured the enemy with mighty blows in his bloodthirsty frenzies, Strygwyr corners his foe into making the impossible decision - bleed to death by trying to outrun the hasty demon, or be ripped to shreds in its awesome fury.</P>

                    <p>What meat Clinkz lacks on his bones, he makes up for in stealth and offensive bursts. He can imbue each arrow attack with a fiery enchantment for heavier damage, and Strafe his quiver for brief moments to fire in rapid succession. He is able to Windwalk, becoming invisible and gaining a great deal of movement speed, making him a potent in-and-out assassin. His ultimate allows him to consume creeps' life essences whole, increasing his hit point capacity and damage output so that he may move on to his next kill that Strafe and Windwalk help to perform. His Searing Arrows deal bonus damage to both units and buildings, making Bone Fletcher also exceptionally good at taking structures down.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <P>The fire that kindles eternally on the visage of the fallen Elven Archer proves to others that his undeath was a mere genesis. Clinkz seeks perfection in the arts of fletching and never hesitates in sacrificing his own allies for the cause. Still retaining his ability to move with the wind, he is ready to slay the enemy officers with his swiftness and precision in archery. The Fletcher fires arrows that scorch the target with the heat of the Underworld, bringing them closer and closer to their peril. An elvish archer in life, a nightmare in death.

                    <p>Regular spiders are scary enough. This overgrown Broodmother takes arachnophobia to a whole new level. Within her web she can remain unseen, is extremely quick, and able to regenerate. The venom in her fangs not only hurts, but can cause one to miss attacks and move slower. Combine this with her ultimate Insatiable Hunger, which empowers her fangs to deal great damage and life leech, and she is one Mother you don't want to go toe to toe with. She also can inject her young from a distance into a target, dealing damage initially, and if that host dies soon after her young will spawn. She can amass young armies quickly, which are great for pushing or even taking down bigger prey if left unchecked.</p>

                    <P>Once a Queen of the Nerubians, she struck fear into the hearts of those she ruled. However she made the fatal mistake of falling in love with the renegade assassin Anub'Arak , and was banished from her own kingdom. Now she accompanies her true love in the battle of the Ancients, bearing his offspring as a symbol of her undying love. An expert in weaving webs of deception, she has the power of incapacitating those who dare attack her, and sowing in them the seeds of her offspring which then tear out of the corpse of the unfortunate victim. Her lust for battle helps her grow stronger and sustain herself, leading many to believe that her hunger for flesh is insatiable.</P>

Following up with his powerful line stunning impale and then Mana Burn is a combo most will instantly fall victim to--hard to see it coming and difficult to escape. His Scarabs can spy the lay of the land to alert him to danger or his next victim.</p>

He was resurrected by the Lich King Ner'zhul, who promised him eternal undeath in exchange for his unswerving loyalty. When threatened, he shoots these spikes through enemies, maiming and disorienting them. He channels his dark powers into a bolt of disarming negative energy, and those who witness him blending into the shadows of the frozen tundra have never lived to tell the tale.</P>
