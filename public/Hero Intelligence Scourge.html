                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Atropos the Bane Elemental has some of the most powerful disabling spells in the game. However, his spells are all single target, so deciding which heroes to cast his spells on in the thick of battle is a crucial skill for Atropos. Nightmare completely disables a target for a long time and deals minor damage, but comes with a drawback. The target can be woken at any time by either an allied or enemy attack, which transfers the Nightmare effect to the attacker. However, attacking a sleeping unit with spells will not transfer the Nightmare effect, making this a fantastic spell for setting up other allies' abilities that are difficult to hit. Brain Sap is a extremely deadly direct damage spell which is unreduced by magic resistance and heals the Bane Elemental with every cast. Enfeeble allows Atropos to render a physical attack hero practically useless for a long duration, and should not be underestimated. Fiend's Grip is the Bane Elemental's most feared ability. This spell deals huge amounts of damage, drains a lot of mana from the target, and completely disables them as long as Atropos is channeling, allowing allies to move in for the kill. With the ability to effectively disable three heroes at once, the Bane Elemental is a great hero for manipulating battles and ambushing enemies.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Atropos is an elemental force personifying the nightmares and fear of this world. He manifests where there is promise of inflicting horror and feeding off dread. Sapping his foes' psyche heals him. Manifesting his enemies' fears, he greatly enfeebles their ability to fight. He revels in disabling foes by sending them into dread slumber. When need be he can rip his soul and force it into his foes, effectively immobilizing them with despair and pain. Atropos is, in one word, Fear.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Dark Seer is a master of manipulating the positioning of allies and enemies and causing confusion in battle. His Vacuum ability drags all enemy units a wide area to a central location. It is very deadly when combined with allies who have strong area of effect spells. The Dark Seer's primary damage source is Ion Shell. When cast on an allied unit or the Dark Seer himself, Ion Shell continuously damages all adjacent enemies, making it the natural complement to Vacuum. Ion Shell is powerful when cast on allied melee heroes who like to be in the thick of the fight. To aid his allies and to make sure Ion Shell is in range, the Dark Seer uses Surge, a powerful spell that makes a target ally move at maximum speed for a short period of time. This ability is useful in any situation, and due to its low cooldown period and mana cost it can be cast quite frequently. The Dark Seer's final spell, Wall of Replica, summons a shimmering barrier which duplicates any enemy hero that passes through it, creating an illusion of him. Wall of Replica is great at causing a lot of confusion during large battles, especially combined with Vacuum. For players who like a more strategic playstyle and can quickly determine the flow of battle, the Dark Seer is a good choice.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Thought by some to be among the most cunning and manipulative among the Scourge's varied champions, the dark seer Ish'kafel, living in exile from his people, is also the most secretive, for he speaks to no one but the Lich King himself. His unconventional talents, which lie in augmenting himself and allies with a variety of both defensive and offensive supportive castings, are quite unusual and versatile, often capable of turning the tide of battle before it even starts.</p>

                    <p>Although her Carrion Swarm spell allows the Death Prophet to be a strong damage spellcaster, she can also make a great tank. By buying items to pump up her hit points and armor and casting her Exorcism spell, the Death Prophet can quickly decimate the enemy team while shrugging off their attempts to stop her. Carrion Swarm is a strong area of effect spell, and with her Witchcraft passive and some mana items the Death Prophet can cast Carrion Swarm very often. Although she lacks any movement disabling abilities, her good movement speed and Silence ability allow her to chase down and kill enemies while keeping them from fighting back. The Death Prophet is especially powerful when attacking enemy towers and bases. Exorcism is one of the few spells which damages buildings, and can quickly level any structure. Carrion Swarm can elimate enemy creep waves, and Silence allows the Death Prophet to deal with defenders. When the Death Prophet uses Exorcism it's best to try to eliminate her as quickly as possible or flee, since the damage will quickly add up.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Krobelus spent her living days as a fervent member of a cult of Death Sayers. Her belief in the ways of death and the perfect harmony it brings has given her dead spirit a chance to wreak havoc among the chaotic living. She uses her abilities to call upon carnivorous bats and long dead spirits to lay to rest all who still pump blood through their veins. She augments her powers through the use of witchcraft, and she is able to make opponents gape in fear, losing the focus needed to cast spells. She is devoted to death in all it's aspects, and would see all turned to ash.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Demon Witch is a strong offensive spellcaster with excellent disabling capabilities. Although his primary attack spell, Impale, deals relatively low damage, it has a long stun at high levels and can hit multiple targets quite easily. The low spell damage of Impale is more than compensated for by Lion's lethal Finger of Death ability, which deals very high damage to a single enemy target. Finger of Death is an excellent finishing spell for injured enemies. Although Impale alone is a good disabling spell, the Demon Witch has a second strong disable: Voodoo. Voodoo can transform an enemy hero into a critter for a few seconds, allowing Lion and his allies time to finish them off. Lion's spells all cost quite a bit of mana, but he can quickly regain it using Mana Drain. This spell is effective for draining an enemy hero's mana while they are disabled or giving Lion a quick mana boost from an enemy Necromancer or Druid of the Talon creep. This hero is a good choice for newer players, but at the same time he is fragile and must stay on the offensive to emerge victorious.</p>

                    <p>A renegade wizard who delved deeper in studying demonic arts, this old aged archmagus was sentenced to damnation by the Dalaran council. As a last resort of escaping death, he performed a forbidden ritual and sold his soul to Archimonde's bidding. Without trace of compassion and with a twisted mind, he seeks retribution to his comrades. He commands earth to stagger those who hinders his path with sharp spikes or siphons their will out. Never hesitating to transmogrify others to impunity nor doubtful of ripping his enemy inward out with his fatal touch, Lion like a predator loves doing it all over again.</p>

                    <p>The Enigma is one of the few heroes who can cast a single spell and change the course of a game. With good summoning and disabling spells, the Enigma is also a great support hero. Malefice is a unique stun, which hits a target several times over a few seconds instead of all at once. This makes it great for chasing down enemy heroes and preventing foes who rely on channeling abilities from casting their spells. To aid his damage output, the Enigma relies on his Conversion spell, which transforms a target creep into three Eidolons which multiply as they attack. This spell can even be cast on powerful neutral creeps, making the Enigma a good neutral creeper and ambusher. The real power of the Enigma is his Black Hole, however. Black Hole is a very powerful channeling spell which completely disables all enemies in a large area around the target location for a good length of time. In addition, it drags them together, providing a perfect target for the spells of the Enigma's allies. To further increase the power of this already deadly spell, the Enigma uses Midnight Pulse, an area of effect spell which causes repeated damage based on the target's maximum life. Although powerful alone, the Enigma is strongest when supported by allies with strong area of effect spells, since they can make the best use of his Black Hole.</p>

                    <p>The result of a collapsed star entombed within a field of elemental magic, Darchrow is one of the most dangerous beings in existence, consuming hundreds of worlds into the void of his hate and hunger. He is not above using his own allies as portals for his own servants to come through. Capable of manipulating both void and shadow in combat, his greatest pleasure is to release the oblivion within him upon the world, creating an abyss that draws enemies ever closer to destruction.</p>

                    <p>The mighty Lich is one of the best heroes at controlling a lane, thanks to his Frost Nova and Dark Ritual spells. Frost Nova is a strong nuke that slows its target, which gives the Lich a good harassment tool. Repeatedly casting Frost Nova and harassing with physical attacks is a surefire way to quickly bring an enemy hero to his knees. However, Frost Nova becomes even more dangerous when coupled with Dark Ritual. This spell allows the Lich to destroy an allied creep and gain mana based on its life. Using this spell helps the Lich by giving him limitless mana for Frost Nova, and hinders his enemies by denying them any experience or gold they would have gained from the destroyed creep. By using Frost Nova and Dark Ritual liberally, the Lich can quickly force any opponent to retreat from his lane. Later in the game the Lich tends to focus on a support role, using his Frost Armor spell to buff the survivability of his allies, and his devastating Chain Frost to blast his foes in team battles.</p>

                    <p>The Necrolyte is an unusual offensive spellcaster, since he has two passive skills and only one primary attack spell. However, this doesn't stop him from being one of the strongest offensive spellcasters around. The Necrolyte's Death Pulse is his bread and butter. This powerful ability doubles as a damage spell and a healing spell, with both effects on every cast. Death Pulse hits all nearby enemies causing damage, and also hits all nearby allies and the Necrolyte which heals them. Since it has a short cooldown period, this spell can be cast very often, providing constant damage to enemies and health to allies and allowing the Necrolyte to plenty of creep kills. To fuel this barrage, a passive skill called Sadist which replenishes some of his mana every time he kills a unit. To further weaken his enemies, his powerful Hearstopper Aura slow drains the life of all foes in a large area of effect around the Necrolyte. When he sees a sufficiently injured enemy hero, the Necrolyte uses Reaper's Scythe, which is possibly the best spell in the game for killing off damaged heroes. This deadly spell deals damage based on how much life the target is missing, so even the toughest heroes die just as a fast as the fragile ones. A strong Necrolyte is nearly impossible to defeat, releasing constant Death Pulses and draining enemies' life with Heartstopper Aura until they are finished.</p>

Taking pleasure and growing more powerful every time a living thing dies by his hands, each step of his reeks of death, and his very presence makes living things rot and wither. Now a master of torture and pain, the Necrolyte mercilessly slays any weaklings who might cross his path, always with a nasty smile on his dead face.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Pugna is a fragile yet versatile spellcaster. Due to his massive base intelligence and high gain per level, he has plenty of mana to cast his spells as much as he wants. Nether Blast is his primary method for dealing damage, and its large area of effect, high strength, and low cooldown make it good for harassing enemy heroes and killing creeps. Nether Blast also deals damage to towers, which makes Pugna a powerful sieging hero with Nether Blast alone. Pugna's Decrepify spell is useful in several ways. It functions as a decent movement speed slowing spell for catching fleeing enemies, and also amplifies spell damage against the target. Decrepify and Nether Blast make a powerful combination. Decrepify can also be cast on allies, and since it prevents the target from being hit by physical attacks, it gives clever Pugna players a way to deal with potentially troublesome physical attack oriented heroes by either Decrepifying the enemy hero (which prevents them from attacking), or an allied hero to prevent them from being attacked. Decrepified enemies can still cast spells, but with Pugna's Nether Ward placed they will be struck by bolts of lightning whenever they use a skill. Finally, Pugna's natural fragility is somewhat mediated by his Life Drain spell, which rapidly heals Pugna while dealing a lot of damage to his target. Pugna is especially effective at shutting down enemy spellcasters with his Nether Ward, but his versatility makes him good in any situation.</p>

                    <p>Forcefully raised from the dead with little memory of his former self, Pugna is truly a terrible sight to behold. Retaining traces of necromantic magic, this shamble of bones finds sadistic pleasure in temporarily sending his enemies into a tormented dimension and greeting their return with a blast of unholy energy. Those who survived an encounter with the horror often recount with fearful eyes of how the Oblivion literally drains life from his enemies, giving him a brief, but satisfying, taste of the living.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Among the small number of intelligence heroes who focus on getting a lot of powerful items late in the game, the Obsidian Destroyer relies on building up as much intelligence and mana as he possibly can.Arcane Orb enhances his attacks with large amounts of unresistable pure damage, and if his mana pool gets high enough the Obsidian Destroyer is capable of killing fragile enemies with only a few Arcane Orb attacks. Astral Prison is a useful ability, which can put a powerful enemy hero out of the fight or save an ally from death. In addition, it drains intelligence when cast on an enemy hero, and by repeatedly using this ability the Obsidian Destroyer can quickly reduce the enemies' mana pool, making it difficult for them to cast many spells. To keep both his own and his allies' mana pools full, the Obsidian Destroyer has a passive skill called Essence Aura. In addition to boosting the Destroyer's own mana pool, this aura gives any allied unit under its effect a chance to instantly regain a portion of their total mana pool every time they cast a spell. Essence Aura fuels Arcane Orb, giving the Destroyer potent damage with little risk of running dry. Although Arcane Orb and Astral Prison make the Destroyer deadly in small engagements, his powerful Sanity's Eclipse spell can turn the tide of large battles. An Obsidian Destroyer with a lot of intelligence items can kill or badly wound several enemy heroes at once with this spell. Few heroes are capable of putting out as much damage as a pumped up Obsidian Destroyer.</p>

                    <p>An obsidian construct brought to life through the ill conceived necromancy of the Lich King, Harbinger craves magic to make up for the emptiness brought on by the incomplete nature of its summoning. Ironically however, to devour the magic that it so desires, Harbinger must tap into his own pool of mana time and time again, expending to the point where it ends up with even less than it began with. Yet despite this, the Obsidian Destroyer is a proud servant of the Undead Scourge, and takes great pleasure in annihilating the foolish Sentinels it encounters through psionic exploitation.</p>

                    <p>The Queen of Pain excels at mobility, area of effect damage, and ambushing enemy heroes. Although she is fairly fragile, her Blink skill allows her to dodge in and out of combat freely, making her deadly on offense and nearly impossible to catch. When ambushing lone heroes, the Queen of Pain often uses Shadow Strike, which slows the target's movement speed and makes it difficult for them to escape. Scream of Pain is an area of effect offensive spell centered on the Queen of Pain. Blink, Shadow Strike, and Scream of Pain make a deadly combination, allowing the Queen of Pain to do a lot of damage quickly to any nearby target. Since she can slow and Blink to catch up to retreating enemies, escaping the Queen of Pain is nearly impossible. Her final spell, Sonic Wave, is a one of the most powerful area of effect spells in the game, and can be used to finish off injured heroes or soften up the enemy team in large battles. The Queen of Pain is a powerful and versatile spellcaster, and due to her high mobility and strong offensive spells she is a favorite of many more experienced players.</p>

Rightly bearing the title, Queen of Pain, she enjoys nothing more than inflicting massive damage on her foes, using both the poisonous strikes of her succubus host and the vicious howls retained from her Banshee nature. Akasha breaks her enemies' eardrums with torturing screams, some so loud they manifest into powerful waves that ripple across the lands, shattering all in their wake.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Although the Warlock is a powerful support hero, his offensive capabilities should not be underestimated. With a strong physical attack and his Shadow Word ability, the Warlock is tough to beat early game. Shadow Word can be used either offensively to deal damage over time, or defensively to heal an ally. Thanks to this versatility, the Warlock can often be found supporting allies against difficult enemies, using his Shadow Word to heal his lane partner or harass an enemy hero. Later in the game the Warlock's other spells come into play. Fatal Bonds links enemy units together, causing them all to take extra damage when one is attacked. This spell is especially effective at increasing the potency of allied area of effect spells. Although somewhat difficult to use well, Upheaval can be a powerful skill in certain situations. If given time to channel, Upheaval is a potent slow with a large area of effect. The Warlock's primary strength, however, is summoning a powerful Infernal with his devastating Rain of Chaos spell. When cast, this ability drops a meteor on the target area of effect, stunning and damaging in a very large area, as well as summoning the powerful demonic Infernal. This ability makes the Warlock great for initiating battles. After being stunned and attacked by a massive Infernal, his foes will likely have little will left to fight.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Former cultist of the Blacksun, Lannik was among the first of many orcs enslaved by the wretched demons when the Legion's taint befell the lands of Kalimdor - a dire affliction that grew stronger over the years. Mannoroth's sudden and unexpected demise severed this Warlock's ties to demonology, and the absence of its corrupting influenced caused his body to wither onto the verge of death. In exchange for life beyond the grave, he bound a pact with the Lich King.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Shadow Demon is one of the strongest supports to setup kills with. Disruption banishes a target enemy for a short time, allowing allies to setup their stuns properly. It can also be used to save an ally from enemy skills. Furthermore, it creates illusions of the targeted hero, which gives Shadow Demon a powerful damage tool if used on carries. Soul Catcher amplifies the damage that an enemy takes, which can make even tanky heroes relatively squishy and lets you and your allies quickly finish off that enemy. Shadow Poison allows Shadow Demon to contribute to the damage output by stacking a DoT on enemies that deals an increasing amount of damage per stack. If that still is not enough, he can use his ultimate to cripple an enemy and deal damage after a short delay. Overall, Shadow Demon might not be a bursty nuker, but with his abilities to purge enemies, setup allied disables, amplify damage and his increasing damage over time, he's a very powerful support in assisting kills.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Long before the war of the Scourge and the Sentinel, an ancient demon named Eredar waged war on all creation. No champion of Light could match him, but he was betrayed and killed by his own underlings. However, the faintest sliver of his shadow survived; over the millenia Eredar regained a portion of his former being and grows stronger each day, even managing to retake his old appearance. Eredar's new form is not well suited to direct confrontation, but he knows a number of objurations and tricks to deal with his foes; his skills include banishment, poison, curses, and darker demonic arts.</p>

                    <p>The Batrider is a highly mobile raider hero, adept at causing confusion and doing a lot of damage quickly. Before moving in for the kill, the Batrider tends to soften up his target with Sticky Napalm, a stacking debuff skill which slows movement speed and turn rate. When he is ready to make his move, the Batrider uses his explosive Flamebreak spell, which strikes the first enemy unit it hits, exploding and knocking back nearby units. When his enemies are sufficiently demoralized, the Batrider swoops in using his Firefly ability and grabs a target hero with Flaming Lasso. This ability allows the Batrider to drag a target hero behind him, pulling the hapless victim away from the safety of his allies and in to the waiting clutches of his enemies. Although he may seem like a support hero, the Batrider is capable of dealing enormous damage with Sticky Napalm, Flamebreak, Firely, and his regular attack, due to the stacking damage provided by Sticky Napalm. It's best to be wary when faced against this hero, as his seemingly suicidal attacks can turn out a lot more dangerous than they appear.</p>

                    <p>Once an expendable spy, Jin'zakk has outlived the suicidal tendencies of other Bat Riders to create a unique style, one that favours control and precision instead of wanton destruction. His years of battle experience have allowed him to innovate creative uses for his fiery arts: He can douse enemies in a bath of sticky oil that restricts their movements before igniting it, fire an explosive that blows enemies away, or take flight to leave behind a trail of flame. However, his most deadly skill involves lassoing his opponent and dragging the unfortunate foe into the arms of his allies.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Shadow Priest is an unusual support spellcaster, who focuses entirely on physical damage rather than magical attacks. Hence, he is extremely effective backing up allies with strong physical attacks. Poison Touch doesn't deal much damage, but it is a very effective slow and stun with a ridiculously short cooldown. Escaping from a Shadow Priest with a high level Poison Touch is nearly impossible. Shadow Wave doubles as a good heal and damage ability. Similar to Poison Touch, this ability may seem weak at first, but due to the extremely low cooldown it can be cast constantly, and with some clever placement can cause a lot of damage. Shallow Grave is an essential ability. When cast on a nearly dead ally, it can prolong life for several crucial seconds, allowing them to escape or cause even more damage before they go down. Often enemies will chase a hero who is under the effect of this spell, believing them to be an easy kill. This is can be a fatal mistake. Finally, the Weave spell gives the Shadow Priest a method for boosting the power of his own spells and also giving his team a significant advantage in any battle. Due to the low cost and cooldown of Weave, Dazzle can cast it at practically every fight with great effect.</p>

                    <p>Little is known to the Shadowtooth Clan, likely because this group of shadowy trolls never unveil the secrets of their mystifying sacrament. Nevertheless, the Loa they worship is much more powerful than most elementals, thus their favors must be kept in confidentiality. In return, these Primal Gods granted these trolls the power over paralyzing toxins, life-bending voodoo, and even endowment of life beyond the grave. A living eternity of death and misery, Dazzle now marches within the ranks of the undead, announcing the apocalypse of the Scourge that may lead them to much anticipated ascendancy.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Visage is an unusual hero. Although his primary stat is intelligence, he shares more in common with strength tank heroes and physical damage agility heroes than spellcasters. Grave Chill provides him a potent chasing ability and powerful slow in one skill. With Soul Assumption, Visage gains strength from hovering near dying creeps. The damage bonus and healing from this skill allow him to remain indefinitely in a lane, killing creeps and harassing with his high damage attack. Combining Grave Chill and Soul Assumption makes Visage a dangerous ranged fighter. Defensively, Gravekeeper's Cloak makes the Necro'lic very difficult to kill if he pumps up his hit points and regeneration, as it reduces all incoming damage and heals all nearby allies at the same time. Visage can also summon a swarm of Revenants, which serve as an additional damage source as well as an extremely effective scouting tool due to their flying movement type. Visage players often focus on the hero's toughness and healing ability, turning him into a hybrid intelligence tank with good physical attack capabilities.</p>

The weakening power of his wrath puts even the greatest warriors in misery, and the sight of sky filled with Visage and his undead minions is unimaginable. He is a nightmare in its worst, most sickening form, a true living horror, the Necro'lic.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Invoker is the most well-rounded spellcasting hero, due to his massive array of spells. Using his three elemental reagents and his Invoke skill, He can utilize a total of 10 different spells. Due to his complexity and fragility, He is a bad choice for newer players. With some experience, however, he becomes a force to be reckoned with. He is capable of massive area of effect damage, powerful disabling spells, very strong summons, and potent enchantments. While other spellcasters tend to be focused in one area, He has the ability to change his role at will. His spells tend to start out weaker than comparable abilities, but since his reagents have 7 levels each his potential spell power is very high.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Quas. Wex. Exort. The essence of a storm. The heart of a blizzard. The soul of a phoenix. After his people were broken and scattered to the corners of the earth, Kael was left with only the relics of his once great world. Thirsting for vengeance, he sold his own soul to Ner'Zhul, and in exchange acquired near limitless power. Taking on the mantle of the Blood Mages of old, the Invoker strode into war with nothing but the elements at his command. He can fuse the elements into deadly incantations, tearing apart the very heavens in his fury. His genius knows no bounds, and the Sentinel shall come to know the rage of the Invoker.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Leshrac's four skills all focus on dealing a lot of damage to his enemies in a variety of ways. He is one of the most powerful direct damage spellcasters, and his spells can even out-damage pumped up physical attack heroes late in the game. Split Earth is an area of effect stun. Although new players will find it can be difficult to hit, it has a relatively low cooldown and is sure to cause a lot of pain if it does connect. Diabolic Edict is an extremely effective spell if used well, causing a huge amount of damage if it hits a single enemy hero for its entire duration. Since it deals physical damage, it is excellent at destroying buildings and fighting magic immune heroes. Lightning Storm is a straightforward spell, but since the cooldown period is only 6 seconds long it is one of the best harassment spells around. In addition, each bounce deals full damage, allowing clever Leshrac players to hit foes from very long range by targeting creeps and letting the lightning bounce to the intended victim. Pulse Nova is Leshrac's final offensive spell, and can potentially deal the most damage of any of his abilities. Although it costs huge amounts of mana to sustain, the damage output of this spell is very high, especially in large battles where it can hit many targets at once.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>The Witch Doctor is a fragile but deadly spellcaster with a unique method of eliminating his foes. His Maledict ability is feared by all, and has the potential for enormous amounts of damage. Heroes under the effect of Maledict will continue to take damage based on how much damage they have taken already. Using Paralyzing Casks, a clever Witch Doctor immobilizes his target, casts Maledict on them, then proceeds to cause as much damage as possible before they run. This is nearly always fatal if the Witch Doctor and his allies can injure the target a good amount after it is Maledicted. To aid in the delayed destruction of his enemies, the Witch Doctor can plant a potent Death Ward, which rapidly attacks nearby heroes as long as the Witch Doctor channels it. Combined with Maledict and Paralyzing Cask, Death Ward is practically a guaranteed kill when ambushing an unsuspecting enemy hero. Voodoo Restoration turns him into a mobile healing fountain, quickly restoring the life of the Doctor and his allies in case an ambush doesn't go according to plan. Although the Witch Doctor's Maledict combo is lethal on its own, it is even more dangerous when combined with allied attacks and spells.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Vol'Jin is a risk-taker. Anyone who has ever crossed paths with him can tell you that. As a voodoo priest, you need a certain degree of it. It's too bad he never learned the value of discretion. Vol'Jin's experiments in jungle magic yielded brilliant results- the ability to mend wounds, casks filled with paralyzing combinations of herbs that could scatter for miles, and even a curse capable of stripping the life force from a living being. Of course, no amount of power gained goes without notice. As Vol'Jin's experiments became more and more unstable and destructive, the Lich King made his move.</p>

                    <p>Difficult to master but easy to admire, Kaldr specializes in making big plays. By laying down an Ice Vortex, he can slow enemies that walk over it and weaken their defenses against his magical arsenal. Cold Feet chills an enemy's toes, and forces it to run lest it be frozen in place. Chilling Touch empowers both the Apparition and his allied heroes with extra magical damage, dealing devastating damage in combination with Vortex. But the Ancient Apparition is most feared for his ultimate ability Ice Blast. With practiced aim, Kaldr can launch a sphere of ice across the entire map, confronting all it touches with freezing cold and exploding for massive damage at its destination. Those frozen by Ice Blast cannot regenerate hp and will shatter if brought near death. Even in the warmth and safety of the fountain, you cannot escape Kaldr's deadly ice.</p>

For countless ages he lay in unbearable anguish until he was discovered by minions of the Lich King. In a vain attempt to gain favour with this ancient soul for his own purposes, the Lich King released him. But this soul no longer knew gratitude, it no longer knew friend from foe, it knew only pain. With its body long since decayed, the soul took up the only form it knew. Consumed with hatred, even a touch from this monstrosity causes agony. Able to conjure devastating ice storms with a mere thought and hurl soul-shattering bolts of frost seemingly impossible distances, this creature punishes all who dare to stand their ground against it.</p>

                    <p>Reanimated as a skeletal Dragon by a powerful undead necromancer from Northrend, Winter Wyvern posthumously retains cold energies. Seeking to annihilate any being radiating the warmth of the living, Winter Wyvern has turned his focus against the Sentinel. Equipped with pure glacial elemental power, his ice can breathe vitality into his own allies or drive hordes of enemies into a locked state of cold insanity that turns them into mortal enemies against their own allies. Able to project this ice into splinters and blast them to cripple entire armies, Winter Wyvern is a wickedly powerful being possessing icy lethality. Many, including the Scourge themselves, have come to wonder how this wintry beast even perished in the first place.</p>
