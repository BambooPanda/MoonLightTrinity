                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Atropos the Bane Elemental has some of the most powerful disabling spells in the game. However, his spells are all single target, so deciding which heroes to cast his spells on in the thick of battle is a crucial skill for Atropos. Nightmare completely disables a target for a long time and deals minor damage, but comes with a drawback. The target can be woken at any time by either an allied or enemy attack, which transfers the Nightmare effect to the attacker. However, attacking a sleeping unit with spells will not transfer the Nightmare effect, making this a fantastic spell for setting up other allies' abilities that are difficult to hit. Brain Sap is a extremely deadly direct damage spell which is unreduced by magic resistance and heals the Bane Elemental with every cast. Enfeeble allows Atropos to render a physical attack hero practically useless for a long duration, and should not be underestimated. Fiend's Grip is the Bane Elemental's most feared ability. This spell deals huge amounts of damage, drains a lot of mana from the target, and completely disables them as long as Atropos is channeling, allowing allies to move in for the kill. With the ability to effectively disable three heroes at once, the Bane Elemental is a great hero for manipulating battles and ambushing enemies.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Atropos is an elemental force personifying the nightmares and fear of this world. He manifests where there is promise of inflicting horror and feeding off dread. Sapping his foes' psyche heals him. Manifesting his enemies' fears, he greatly enfeebles their ability to fight. He revels in disabling foes by sending them into dread slumber. When need be he can rip his soul and force it into his foes, effectively immobilizing them with despair and pain. Atropos is, in one word, Fear.</p>

                    <p>Although all Dryads are Cenarius' daughters, Aiushtha is said to be his first and favorite. Because of her direct relation to him, she has borrowed much of his power. This is demonstrated by her control over the shy Wisps which she uses to heal her allies, and her ability to bring an opponent under the will of the Sentinel. Preferring ranged combat to melee, she fashioned a spear that strikes with more force the further her target is away. Her agility is unmatched, and any opponent attempting to kill her will find she skips ahead of them with surprising ease.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Loved by aggressive players everywhere, Puck the Fairie Dragon is one of the best heroes in the game at starting fights. Puck's skills are useful in any situation, giving him a lot of flexibility and making him a great hero in both support and offensive roles. His signatue skill, Illusory Orb, is an example of this. Although it functions like a regular line damage spell, at any time during its course Puck can use his Ethereal Jaunt skill and instantly teleport to the position of the Illusory Orb. This makes the spell useful in both attacking and escaping. It also works perfectly with his second offensive spell, Waning Rift. Waning Rift deals damage and silences in an area around Puck, making it the natural choice for use after an Illusory Orb and Ethereal Jaunt. Puck's final offensive spell, Dream Coil, can be used either before or after this combo with great effect. Dream Coil traps enemies in a small area, forcing them to remain near the target point or take damage and get stunned. To complement his need to get up into his target's face, Puck has Phase Shift to help in sticky situations. Phase Shift renders Puck invulnerable for several seconds, although he is unable to move in this state. Puck is a relatively easy hero to pick up, but a rewarding one to master.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>In Sentinel's search for heroes to aid them in the war against the Scourge, they discovered the lost lands of the mystical Faerie Dragons. Upon explaining the conflict to the Faerie Queen of Agrace, she sent forth Puck, a personal guardian, to turn the tides of war. Despite his small size and mischievous personality, the little dragon soon proved to pack more than his fair share of power on the battlefield, blasting through the enemy ranks with balls of magic, faerie dust, and the capability to stupefy an entire army with nothing more than his imagination. His foes all learned the hard way that size matters not in combat, and that appearances are, ultimately, deceiving.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Chen's standard gameplay is different than most other heroes. His Holy Persuasion skill allows him to convert creeps to his side, including powerful neutral creeps such as the Centaur or Furbolg. As a result, Chen is usually found in the forest searching for creeps to convert. When he finds a strong creep or two, he descends on his unwary enemies, using both his own spells and the abilities of his persuaded creeps to take them out. Due to the difficulty of effectively controlling multiple units and abilities, Chen can be a tricky hero to play to his full potential. When ambushing an enemy hero, Chen generally uses his Penitence ability, which slows the target and causes them to take extra damage from Chen and his allies. The Holy Knight can use Test of Faith to finish off enemies, but it also doubles as a way to save allies who are in danger. Casting Test of Faith on an ally will teleport them to safety after a short time. Chen's support skills are rounded out by Hand of God, a healing spell which instantly restores a set amount of life to all allied heroes across the battlefield. Although Chen can be difficult for newer players, users with experience controlling multiple units effectively will find him very powerful.</p>

                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>A hero for the adrenaline junkies, the Storm Spirit provides arguably the best non stop movement of any hero. When equipped with a lot of items, the Storm Spirit can be seen bouncing around the battlefield, zapping his foes and quickly jumping away. Raijin relies partly on his physical attack and partly on his spells to defeat his enemies. Static Remnant is his main source of spell damage. When cast, this ability leaves a staticky copy of the Storm Spirit behind. Similar to a landmine the image will explode on contact, shocking all nearby enemies. Electric Vortex is a very powerful disabling spell, which grabs a target enemy and drags them to the Storm Spirit. A common tactic is to use Electric Vortex to pull a target into a Static Remnant image. Overload completes this combo, giving the Storm Spirit's next attack a blast of electrical energy whenever he casts a spell. However, Raijin's signature ability is definitely Ball Lightning. This teleportation spell has no cooldown and no maximum range, which means Raijin can bounce about as much as he wants, as long as he has the mana and regeneration to support the high cost of the spell. Raijin behaves much like a storm, starting out weak early on, then gathering power over the course of the game until he becomes an unstoppable force of nature.</p>

                    <h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>A celestial being summoned to aid the Sentinel in their darkest hour; the Storm Spirit chose to manifest itself in the life essence of a humble elementalist, Raijin Thunderkeg. Though the Pandaren's soul perished during the profound surge of pure electrical essence, the divine entity even now seeks refuge in Raijin's body, unable to thrive on its own. However, despite its mortal imprisonment, the Storm Spirit is far from being limited of its tremendous powers. Able of manipulating vast, inexhaustible sources of energy in mysterious ways, it swiftly hails destructive sparks of lightning upon the Sentinel's adversaries, eradicating all that dared to cross its path.</p>
