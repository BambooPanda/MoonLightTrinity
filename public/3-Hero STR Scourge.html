                    <p>Mogul Khan's ability to disrupt an enemy team is legendary, his tanking skills renowned. His Battle Hunger gives enemies the choice between staying back and taking damage, or engaging in battle and risking being trapped by Berserker's Call. The extremely effective combination of Berserker's Call and Counter Helix can cause massive amounts of damage to a large group of enemies, while allowing his allies free reign. If an enemy should manage to escape his Call, Mogul Khan can abruptly end their life with his mighty Culling Blade. Truly, the Axe is an enemy to be feared, lest his opponents taste his blade!</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>n the war of Humans and Orcs that occured long ago many Orcish warriors were corrupted by demonic influence and became tools of blackest darkness. One such warrior was the leader of the Half-Tribe of the Bloodied Axe Clan; Mogul Kahn. Mogul was slain by human Paladins but mysteriously was seen fighting alongside the Scourge around the time Mannoroth started to command the Orcs in the war against Archimonde. The Axe has been revived by demons and uses his reflexes and powerful blows to hunt down and seek out the Sentinels' agile warriors and cut them down to size, even projecting his lust for war onto them.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Chaos Knight has one of the highest damage potentials among strength heroes. He is capable of dealing out a lot of punishment with his powerful critical hits and illusions. In addition, he offers good mobility and a strong stun. Chaos Bolt, as indicated by its name, is a strong but random ability. It deals a random amount of damage over a set range, and stuns the target for a variable length of time based on the level of the skill. It can either be very effective or mediocre, depending on the Chaos Knight's luck. Similarly, his critical strike has a fairly low chance of activating, but the damage payoff is the highest of any non-ultimate critical hit. The Chaos Knight is quite mobile for a strength hero. His Reality Rift instantly teleports you, any images you have and the target unit to a random point along the line between the two of you, while giving Chaos Knight a damage bonus.</p>

He stands opposed with all his might against the powers of Order and Good. He uses his ability to call upon chaotic energy to damage and stun an enemy for a random length of time in conjunction with his power to rip holes in space to instantly strike down all that stand against him. His powers culminate into the terrifying Phantasm, creating avatars of himself who do full damage to all those who oppose him, confusing the battlefield and wreaking havoc amongst the forces of Good.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The mighty Doom Bringer is a versatile and dangerous foe. His offensive spells are very damaging. LVL? Death allows him to pick off heroes at range, and deals extra damage against heroes of certain levels. The dreaded Doom is one of the most feared spells in the game, and with good reason. Not only does it deal massive damage over time to its target, it also silences them completely for its duration. Although the Doom Bringer is no pushover in physical combat, he lacks any dedicated fighting abilities. Instead, he relies on Devour to feed his appetite for powerful items, and buffs his movement and attack speed with Scorched Earth. With his good income, strong damage spells, and the ability to effectively knock a single enemy hero out of a fight, the Doom Bringer is a formidable opponent in any matchup.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Lucifer was the leader of the Doomguard attack force of the burning legion in the first attack by the dark lord Sargeras. With his original master long gone, Lucifer grants his undying loyalty to the Scourge to finish what his lord once started. Devouring the insignificant for his greed while dissipating the souls of those brave and strong enough to withstand his strength and the heat of his fiery haven of burning earth, Lucifer takes no prisoners and makes sure those who persevere through his wrath die by the agonizing and burning pain of Doom itself.

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>A vicious and insidious creature, the Lifestealer is particularly good at tearing tough heroes down. Using his Feast passive skill, which deals damage and steals life based on the hit points of the target, he can serve as a powerful anti-tank hero. Open Wounds allows him to immobilize his prey and encourages allies to move in for the kill, giving life steal on all attacks against the target for a short period of time. It is likely enemies will try to stop the Lifestealer with spells of their own, but using his terrifying Rage skill he becomes temporarily magic immune and gains an attack speed bonus, giving him time to rip apart his enemies. Due to his up-close and personal fighting style, N'aix sometimes gets in over his head. If this happens, he can make use of his Infest ability. Infest allows the Lifestealer to burrow inside any non-hero unit, rendering him completely hidden from enemy eyes. When ready, N'aix can burst from his victim, stealing a large amount of their life and killing them instantly.</p>

                    <p>There once was a man in Lordaeron so consumed by greed that he was beyond remorse. Eventually caught trying to steal Prince Arthas' sacred ring, he was tried and hanged. Yet his body, so corrupted by his desire to steal, rose by itself in the form of a monstrous ghoul. So came into being N'aix, his old name long forgotten: the embodiment of lust and greed, bent on stealing the life of every living creature he encounters.

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>There are few heroes who are more difficult to kill than the Lord of Avernus. Using his Aphotic Shield, Abaddon can cast barriers around any friendly unit which absorb a set amount of damage before exploding, dealing the absorbed damage back to nearby attackers. When under threat himself, Abaddon uses Borrowed Time, which can give him new life if he is in danger. For several seconds, Borrowed Time reverses the effect of all incoming damage and makes it heal Abaddon instead. Many enemies who were sure of their victory have fallen upon the Lord of Avernus intent on destroying him, only to find him completely healed by their attacks. In addition to his own near-invulnerability, Abaddon can heal allies with his Death Coil spell. At the cost of some of his own life, the Lord of Avernus can either heal an allied unit or damage a foe.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>A former paladin of great renown, Abaddon fell into darkness during the invasion of the Burning Legion, becoming possessed by many demons, corrupting both his soul and his powers. Now a Death Knight set high in the Lich King's hierarchy of generals, he rides into battle against impossible odds, never stopping until he reaches the World Tree itself. Whether enhancing his own fortitude with a shield of dark energy, or using his life force to aid in combat, the Lord of Avernus leads the armies of the Scourge ever onward, forever locked in combat with the forces of good, and his enemies who were once his greatest comrades.</p>

                    <p>Banehallow the Lycanthrope focuses on sudden, swift attacks. He can often be found lurking the forest with his wolves, then suddenly bursting forth with a dread howl, chasing down and killing fragile enemy heroes. His wolf companions are deadly fighters, and are capable of dealing a lot of damage on their own. They are also excellent at helping the Lycanthrope kill neutral units, allowing him to get a lot of gold without letting enemy heroes know where he is. While hidden, the Lycanthrope can use his Howl ability, which infuses all allies across the map with extra damage. Feral Impulse grants sizable damage and attack speed bonuses to both Banehallow and his summons. When he deems the time is right, the Lycanthrope transforms into his wolf form with Shapeshift.</p>

                    <p>Banehallow is an avatar of bestial fury created by the scourge. For years he has dwelled in the dark forests of the world, hunting innocents that wander therein. Now he is called to aid his masters. He revels in blood and battle, using his wolfish persona to draw the feral beasts to his side and imbue his allies with his flesh-shredding strength. He is also unnaturally quick and agile. Some say he can even transform into a giant wolf, giving him more durability and the speed to gouge and maim with near impunity.</p>

Balanar's passive Hunter in the Night increases his movespeed and attackspeed at night making him a feared ganker and chaser. His Void spell damages the target and slows them to a crawl allowing Balanar and his allies to deal great amounts of damage when cast during nighttime. Crippling fear is a powerful weapon against spellcasters and fighters alike as it both silences and causes a large chance of missing on physical attacks for its duration. Balanar's ultimate "Darkness" allows him to instantly transform day into night (or prolong the night), providing for the fullest effect of his other spells. However, nobody fears the Nightstalker during the day...</p>

Balanar, elite dreadlord who brought the total darkness of the Nether into this world, haunts these regions. Your heart will pump harder, your legs will shake, and your mind will cloud as the presence of the stalker hunts you in the dark. There's no chance to fight, no way to run, and no place to hide - darkness is everywhere! You can pray, you can cry, but the darkness won't be stopped - until you die.</p>

He can trap many foes at once, rain fire on them and make their bodies explode after. He's a deadly combination that satisfies the devil's love for fire and death, but he can also instantly transport every ally and himself to another battle field, making him a valuable leader of the undead, always present where he is needed.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>One of the many regents of Lord Archimonde who became stranded on the physical plane after the Legion fell in Kalimdor, the devil Azgalor's love of destruction allowed him to accept the Lich King's invitation to help lead the Scourge in conquest with few regrets. After all, this Pit Lord is happiest when he conjures fire to scorch his opponents from above, roasting them slowly as the dead literally explode from beneath their feet. With such hateful power in the hands of a monster such as this, it's no wonder he inspires so much terror as he roams across the battlefield.

                    <p>Pudge the Butcher is one of the most difficult heroes to play effectively, but also one of the most rewarding. His Meat Hook skill is extremely deadly, but also difficult to utilize. A well placed Meat Hook will snag an enemy hero and drag them to the Butcher, dealing a lot of damage along the way. Once the target has been hooked, Pudge uses his other two active skills to finish them off. Rot is a toggled damage over time skill which affects all nearby enemies and also Pudge himself. Pudge must be careful when using this skill. Although it does a lot of damage it can quickly drain his life and make him easy prey for enemies. To stop his target from escaping or fighting back, Pudge can use his Dismember ability. This short range skill deals even more damage and completely immobilizes the target. When used in succession, these three skills make Pudge a dangerous assassin, although he may not look like it. To aid his risky gameplay, Pudge has a passive skill called Flesh Heap. Flesh Heap provides some magic resistance which reduces the damage he takes from rot, and gives him a minor permanent bonus to his strength every time he kills a unit.</p>

It is said his victims catch only a glimpse of his monstrous frame as they are dragged them through the shadows, bleeding profusely as a jagged hook etches deeper in their flesh. Wails of agony echo in the distance, only to be drowned out by the Butcher's maniacal laughter as he severs their limp bodies with his great maw. Unspeakable horrors ensue in a deathly silence, a dreadful omen for what is to come.</p>

                    <p>Despite the overall simplicity of the Skeleton King's skills, he is one of the most dangerous close combat heroes to fight against, and he becomes extremely powerful when equipped with good items. Hellfire Blast is his one active spell, and it allows him to catch and kill enemies. Vampiric Aura and Critical Strike make him deadly in a straight fight; the Skeleton King hits hard and gains life with every attack. Even if Leoric seems to be destroyed, he is still not beaten. This is where his signature ability comes in: Reincarnation. As long as Reincarnation is ready and the Skeleton King has enough mana, he will revive where he fell after a few seconds at full strength. Reincarnation makes the Skeleton King very difficult to defeat, since you essentially have to kill him twice.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Once a noble knight protecting his kingdom, the man was thrown into Hell, where he was ripped apart over and over for centuries. Now, Lucifer has thrown him back onto the soil, corrupted and mindless, as King Leoric, the Skeleton King. He marches on, leading his minions with an unfaltering gaze, knowing only one thing: the orders given to him by the dark lord himself. Able to cripple his opponents by drawing power from the fiery depths of hell itself, King Leoric is a major threat on the battlefield. His mighty blade allows him and others in his presence to drain the blood of their enemies. It is said that he is unkillable, and those who are struck down by his hellfire don't wake up again.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Slardar is a powerful close range stunner and physical damage fighter. He excels at chasing down fragile heroes and bashing them into the dirt. Slithereen Crush and Bash allow him to stun and damage a target, then follow up with additional bashes to keep them stunned and finish them off. To get into close enough range to make use of his stun skills, Slardar uses Sprint. Sprint gives him a massive movement speed bonus for a relatively long duration, but causes him to take extra damage from enemy attacks and spells.</p>

                <li>
                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>After a millennium of being trapped under the raging waters of the Maelstrom, Slardar rose from its chaotic depths with his brethren to serve the mighty demon lord, Illidan Stormrage. Fanatically devoted to his cause, this Naga fought valiantly along his side until he succumbed to fatal wounds in the heat of battle. Salvation finally seemed within grasp - that is until his fate became intertwined with the grim reach of the Lich King. Reincarnated as a soulless beast without emotion, Slardar tears through the enemy lines with inhuman speed, striking them out cold with mighty blows, undeterred in his quest to fulfill Ner'zhul's every whim.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>An aptly named strength caster, the Undying represents a lasting and formidable presence in teamfights whose abilities get stronger as the fight persists. With three heals, Dirge is one of the most survivable and versatile casters. Decay damages enemies in an AoE and steals their strength, giving it to Dirge. Soul Rip can heal Dirge or his allies, or alternatively damage enemies, with its power depending on the number of units in the area. To create more available souls, Dirge can make a Tombstone, which continually raises the dead from the ground to attack and slow enemies. And when he gets really angry, Dirge can transform into the hideous Flesh Golem, slowing and amplifying all damage to enemies around him and recovering HP whenever one of them dies. Though Dirge cannot rapidly take down single enemies, a large group without proper area control will find itself smothered by the stench and attacks of numerous living dead, unable to cope with the unstoppable destruction of the Undying.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Considered to be an exceptionally filthy and despicable specimen by all who encounter him, including his fellow zombies, Dirge has wandered in from the wastes outside to serve the Lich King in hopes of finally obtaining a place of acceptance amongst the Undead masses. While he is still considered to be unpleasant as ever by the rest of the Scourge, his horrifying abilities, which include raising lesser ghouls and spreading vile, rapidly communicable plague throughout the enemy ranks, are unquestionably powerful and may just give the Scourge the edge they need to complete their unholy conquest once and for all.</p>

                    <p>A massive sea monster of incredible strength and toughness, Leviathan is a real tank. Using his Gush skill, he can slow and damage a single target while reducing their armor, allow the Tidehunter and his allies to pummel the target to a pulp. To aid his close combat skills, the Leviathan has a powerful Anchor Smash passive skill, which gives him a chance to unleash a devastating area of effect spin with every attack. A target of Gush who is hit by an Anchor Smash or two is in deep trouble. To protect himself while chasing down and smashing enemies, Leviathan has a second passive: Kraken Shell. This ability reduces all damage from physical attacks by a set number, allowing the Leviathan to wade into combat without fear, ignoring the blows of lesser foes.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Formerly considered by the Old Gods as an oeuvre of the cosmos, Leviathan was thrown into the watery abyss after an alleged connivance with the Titans whom they have fought against. Chained to an anchor and guarded by a virtually indomitable kraken, the Tidehunter had lain dormant in the unfathomable depths for eons until he finally mustered enough strength to break away. He killed his enslaver, took its shell as armor and the once loathed anchor became his weapon. Unforgiving and frigid as the sea, Leviathan had sworn to disembowel everyone who would dare disturb his much valued freedom as he knocks them out with ravaging force. The terror of the tides had come at last and all those who will try to stop him shall be swept away.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Magnataur's primary role is using his powerful Reverse Polarity ability to ensure his team's victory in battle. With proper placement, a single Reverse Polarity can change the outcome of a team battle and potentially win the game. If combined with other area of effect spells, Reverse Polarity can destroy an entire enemy team. However, Magnus himself is no pushover in combat. Using Empower and Mighty Swing in conjunction gives him a very strong physical attack capable of damaging multiple bunched up units, perfect when used after Reverse Polarity. In addition, Magnus has an area of effect spell of his own: Shockwave. Due to its relatively low mana cost and cooldown coupled with its high damage, Shockwave is an effective tool for harassing enemies in a lane and finishing off damaged foes. Although the power of Reverse Polarity tends to overshadow his other skills, Magnus is far from a one-skill hero.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Maybe the most tremendous being on the Scourge, Magnus is a power to be reckoned with. Trained from birth to become a potent warrior, he is now at the peak of his strength. The Magnataur's giant axe can cleave paths through his enemies, and create a bone-breaking shockwave that ripples through the ground. Further strengthened by a demonic magic that enhances his attacks, he can crush enemies with shocking ease. His greatest power, though, is the ability to create an immensely strong magnetic field, sucking in helpless foes to meet their end.</p>

                    <p>True to his name, the Spiritbreaker is excellent at crushing the fight out of an enemy target. His skills are focused on disabling and killing a single enemy hero, making him much more effective in ambushes and one on one situations than large team battles. The Spiritbreaker generally opens with a Charge of Darkness, which allows him to charge from any point on the map towards the target, increasing in speed as he approaches his target. Upon arrival, he delivers a crushing stun, giving him time to follow up with his other active ability: Netherstrike. Netherstrike is a short range teleporting attack, which knocks the target back and deals massive damage.</p>

Found and recruited by the Lich King, Barathrum's uncanny speed and wraithlike powers have now been unleashed upon the Material Plane, his lantern able to project nether energy into enemies, sending them backwards with sudden force.

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Sand King emphasizes area of effect damage more than most. All four of his abilities can damage multiple foes at once. Burrowstrike, his mainstay, damages and stuns targets in a line. In addition, when using this ability, the Sand King burrows to the target location which sets him up for additional attacks or spells. This can get him into trouble though, and to help evade counter attacks Crixalis uses Sand Storm. While active, this ability makes the Sand King invisible in the middle of a swirling storm of dust. Although he is unable to move while remaining invisible, nearby enemies will take damage as long as they remain in the storm.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>A guardian of the ancient Nerubian Kingdom of Azjol-Nerub, Crixalis fled to the deserts of Kalimdor in an attempt to escape the genocide of the Lich King. The harsh climate transformed this warrior into a master of the earth, able to tear the skin off his foes with vicious sand storms. Those unfortunate to succumb to his potent toxins are condemned to violently burst apart in a cloud of noxious fumes. Sensing his growing power, the Lich King sought out Crixalis and, unable to sway him, slew him in battle. Summoned to aid the Undead Scourge, the heart of the Sentinel quivers each time the ground trembles beneath them.</p>
