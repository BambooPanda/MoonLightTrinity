                	<h3>HERO INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>Seemingly slow and cumbrous in battle, the Treant Protector is a supporter who can help other lanes win without being near while being a powerful and durable supporter in larger fights, increasing the life expectancy of his team significantly. His most prominent ability is Living Armor, a protective skill he can cast globally that heals an allied unit and grants a few protective layers that can block any form of damage. It also works on buildings, so it doubles as a mighty tool for saving allies from forlorn battles and keeping towers alive. When he joins fights himself, he does not hesitate to infect the enemies with Leech Seed, a spell that drains health from a targeted enemy and spreads it to nearby allies while slowing the foe. This makes it an ideal tool to ensure successful ganks early on and keep the team alive in the lategame. If he wants to initiate a bigger teamfight, he can prepare his whole team with Nature's Guise, a low-cooldown ability that allows him to render his team invisible one-by-one as long as they remain near trees. Since Rooftrellen himself stays invisible even when he casts spells, he can also stay in fights and help his team when he is low on health. Last but not least, his ultimate is Overgrowth. It enables him to root enemies in place in a huge area around him, disabling both movement and their attacks for several seconds. With nothing but their spells left to defend, they are at the mercy of the Treant Protector's team.</p>

                	<h3>BACKGROUND STORY</h3>
                    <p>A treant of immense age and wisdom, Rooftrellen was merely a sapling during the invasion of the Burning Legion. Having grown powerful over thousands of years, Rooftrellen has lent his considerable might to the Sentinel cause. An omnipresent force in the forest, he is capable using his power over the forest to hide his allies. Rooftrellen is aided by the forest itself, providing him with a thick living armor of vines and entangling nearby foes in a deadly embrace, allowing Rooftrellen to pound his victims to dust with his massive gnarled limbs.</p>
