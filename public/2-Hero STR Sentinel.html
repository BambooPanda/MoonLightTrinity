                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Daelin Proudmoore is a fearsome opponent in nearly any situation. His passive ability, Tidebringer, causes his sword to splash out massive damage over an area when he attacks, making him not only a constant threat in the lane, but a excellent damage dealer later in the game. Through the deadly combination of X Marks the Spot and Torrent, he can also pick off his fleeing enemies at will. He's not at a loss in large team clashes either; His ultimate summons the legendary ship S.S. CoCo, which empowers his allies with rum and crashes into enemies, causing massive devastation. This ruthless admiral leaves none alive, least not dry!</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Of all the allies in the Sentinel's ranks, only one, is known by as many names and is feared in as many lands. Called Capt. CoCo by his mates, Jacksparrow by others, The Legendary Mariner by some, but only a select few know his real name and what it stands for. He can harness the powers of the depths to conjure torrential geysers that blast his enemies into the air. His elegant blade is sworn to the Seas and with each mighty swing it ebbs like the tides. Using a watery form of spacial magic, he can bring you back to your original destination. The Captain now sails towards the Scourge lands, aboard his Phantom vessel boosting the spirits of his comrades with his fabled Rum, paving the way for the victory of the Sentinel. He is Kunkka, Master and Commander of the seven seas.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Beastmaster is a very well-rounded fighter, with many tactical options available for all types of combat. Although his physical attacks are melee, he can throw his axes at long range to slice through enemies, dealing lethal damage. His Primal Roar can turn the most organized defense into chaos, allowing the Beastmaster and his allies to move in for the kill. His summoning skills serve as effective support for his blitz-style combat. Rexxar's agile Hawk flies above the battlefield scouting for enemies, and the powerful slowing abilities of his Quillbeast's spines give him time to finish off fleeing foes. A skilled Beastmaster is a deadly foe, capable of fighting any enemy on any terms and crushing them to a pulp.</p>

A friend of beasts, Rexxar flails and tears at his enemies with unsettling savagery, even going as far as hurling his axes in the manner of boomerangs at his enemies to better his chances at victory. Truly a warrior of the living planet that thrives around him, the Beastmaster is an ally to be counted on when he is needed the most.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Centaur Warchief's toughness and survivability are legendary. The best place for this tank of a hero is in the center of combat, where his close range skills and massive vitality can be put to use. The Warchief's Hoof Stomp can incapacitate any enemies foolish enough to go toe-to-toe with him for several crucial seconds, giving the Warchief and his allies time to finish them off. The Warchief can also deliver a single lethal blow at the cost of some of his own life with Double Edge. In addition, the Warchief's passive Return skill deals damage to attackers, making bringing this beast down a difficult and risky proposition at best. His charismatic leadership can rally ally forces to race across the toughest terrains, leaving his trampled enemies sluggish in its wake.</p>

                    <p>Gifted with a tremendous body and an ever-growing fortitude, Bradwarden's courage is only matched by the size of his heart. Prophesied as a savior by the oracles of his tribe, Bradwarden is the living token of the allegiance of the centaurs to the Sentinel. He swings his axe with massive force, sometimes even hurting himself when doing so. The ground trembles every time he slams his hoof and his reflexes are impossible to surpass; allowing him to retaliate just after being attacked. Bradwarden is decided to fulfill his destiny, and he knows that the upcoming battle will become his ultimate challenge.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Although the Earthshaker is a strength hero, his real power lies in his spells. With a well-placed Echo Slam, Raigor can single-handedly level an entire team of enemies if they are foolish enough to bunch together. His Fissure spell is very versatile. While it deals decent damage along with a stun, it also creates an impassible wall of rock for several seconds. A skilled Earthshaker can use this to his advantage, blocking enemy movement and trapping hapless foes between a rock and a hard place. Enchant Totem gives him a significant damage boost for one attack, and his passive Aftershock ability causes a minor stun and damage effect under him every time he casts one of his spells. Although he is one of the more difficult heroes to use to his full strength, he is also one of the most deadly heroes in skilled hands.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>In the barren-lands, tales spoke of tauren sages reaping the essence of dirt. Their consciousness melds with the brown beneath them. The loam becomes the conduit of their mental thought and reality. These warriors were feared for they could summon massive ruptures at their mere whim. So tremendous was their power that their magic leaks out of the earth violently with every spell. Sadly these sages mysteriously faded from the land. When the World Tree was threatened, couriers searched for these mighty ones but found just one. A young adept, Raigor Stonehoof, seeks battle to weave new tales of these shamans.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>A noble hero through and through, the Omniknight uses his powerful support and healing abilities to turn the tide of battle. Purification, a direct healing spell, instantly heals a large portion of the targets life. However, it doubles as a powerful offensive ability, dealing massive damage to all foes surrounding the target being healed. Repel allows the Omniknight to make a target ally immune to most spells for an extended period of time, although it makes them unable to be targeted by Purification. Enemies who try to escape Purist's holy wrath will find it difficult to flee from his Degeneration Aura, which passively slows the movement of all nearby foes. Finally, his Guardian Angel can single-handedly turn the tide of any battle. This powerful protective spell grants all allies within range near-invulnerability to physical damage, as well as rapid healing. His peerless support skills in the heat of battle make the Omniknight an invaluable member of any team.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>A former member of the Order of the Silver Hand, Purist has joined the Sentinel to avenge the death of the Order's leader, Uther the Lightbringer. Trained by Uther himself in the ways of the Paladin, Purist brings the power of the Holy Light to the battlefield. He can purify the souls of allies, harming any nearby Scourge in the process. Able to protect allies from harmful unholy magic, the mere presence of a man of the Holy Light atrophies any nearby enemies. In times of dire need, Purist can call upon God himself to protect him and his allies.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Brewmaster uses the ancient art of drunken fighting to bash his enemies to a bloody pulp while surviving even the most deadly attacks with ease. Thunder Clap deals a lot of damage to nearby enemies while slowing them significantly, giving the Brewmaster time to bash their skulls in with his drunken brawling skills. If an enemy seems too dangerous the Brewmaster douses them with Drunken Haze, which causes the majority of the target's physical attacks to miss their mark. Heroes who rely on physical attacks will find the Brewmaster nearly impossible to damage when he uses Drunken Haze and Drunken Brawler. In addition, even if the Brewmaster does seem to be in danger, he can split into three powerful elemental aspects with Primal Split. Each individual elemental panda is a dangerous fighter with their own unique abilities. The Brewmaster is a difficult enemy to defeat, and should be engaged only with overwhelming force.</p>

                    <p>Mangix originates from a deeply hidden and secret society located on the obscure island of Pandaria. He lived a sheltered life in his home within the Stonetalon Mountains, but even the far, golden reaches of Pandaria were affected by the dark hand of the Scourge. The elders heard the cries of the innocent, and saw the blood of the slain, and so, they agreed to send one elite warrior, hoping to turn the tides of battle and restore the Great Balance. What they did not know was that the local barkeep had trained for this very moment his entire life.</p>

                    <p>Sven is all about getting pumped up. His skills allow him to deal a lot of area of effect damage to several targets at once. Storm Bolt is a powerful damage spell, which stuns both the target and all surrounding units for several seconds, allowing Sven to catch up and deal with them. His Warcry ability helps, giving Sven and nearby allies a temporary movement speed and armor bonus so they can charge quickly and fearlessly. Sven's foes should be especially fearful of his powerful physical attacks. God's Strength pumps Sven's damage up to very high levels, and Cleave turns every attack into an area of effect strike. Although his gameplay is fairly straightforward, Sven should not be underestimated. The best course of action when faced with a fully pumped Sven is to run.</p>

He has come out of his wanderings determined to guard the innocent against evil. Armed with his blessed cleaving blade Justice, and harnessing the power to strike down his enemies with the might of God's Strength, Sven's wrath toward the unjust is a sight to behold.</p>

                    <p>Although his name seems fitting at first, over time Tiny the Stone Giant will grow both in size and strength. His immense strength allows him to grab the closest enemy and toss them through the air towards a target unit. Combining this with Tiny's Avalanche spell gives him incredible area of effect damage. However, Tiny is also extremely dangerous in one on one situations. With proper timing Tiny can Toss an enemy who is taking damage from Avalanche, and if the target lands back in the Avalanche they will take double damage. This is often enough to instantly kill more fragile heroes, although tougher heroes should be wary of engaging the Stone Giant as well. Tiny's Craggy Exterior can occasionally stun close range attackers, giving him time to escape or punish them with his crushing blows. If possible, it's best to keep this mobile mountain at arm's length.</p>

                    <p>Looming from the rocky crags of Ashenra, the stone giants are born from the mountain itself. Tiny, a newly born giant, although small in size, has the strength of a hill. With his supreme strength, he is able to launch anything into the air, including huge amounts of soil to cause avalanches around his enemies. Because of his craggy exterior, enemies have a hard time attacking him. Over time, Tiny's body will grow bigger as the magnetic forces deep inside his granite heart pull rocks and soil to his rugged stone form.</p>

                    <p>The Tauren Chieftain is a strong physical damage dealer who can disable and destroy many heroes at once with his spells. Most of the Chieftain's abilities revolve around the guardian spirit which aids him in battle. Using Ancestral Spirit, Cairne can temporarily separate the guardian spirit from himself. While the spirit is separate, it causes damage to enemies it strikes and mimics the Chieftain's movement and Echo Stomp ability. When the spirit and Cairne rejoin, he gains a boost to his physical damage and move speed, the strength of which depends on how many enemies the spirit collided with. This makes him a very dangerous physical attacker, especially combined with his offensive aura, Natural Order. This ability reduces the base armor and magic resistance of all nearby units, giving the Chieftain's attacks and spells a significant boost to their damage. His final ability is called Earth Splitter, a powerful area of effect spell which can cause severe damage and disable many enemies at once. Since it takes a few seconds to have any effect and is easy to dodge on its own, it's best to combo this ability with either Echo Stomp or allied disabling spells. However, if multiple enemy heroes are hit by this ability, it generally spells their doom.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Since ancient times it has been prophesized by the Tauren elders that a Chieftain will come, strong as the mightiest warriors and wise as the eldest shamans. After many years of wandering the sacred lands, seeking wisdom from his forefathers, Cairne Bloodhoof has proven himself as the long awaited hero. Cairne carries with him the spirit of his mightiest ancestor, and now the ground shakes with the combined strength of the Chieftain and his guardian spirit. No physical nor magical barrier can reduce the power of his enchanted halberd, the weapon used by his guardian in ancient times. Such is the power of this axe that it can split the very earth itself. Seeking revenge for the ravaging of his homeland, Cairne will soon bring his wrath upon the Scourge.</p>

His most prominent ability is Living Armor, a protective skill he can cast globally that heals an allied unit and grants a few protective layers that can block any form of damage. It also works on buildings, so it doubles as a mighty tool for saving allies from forlorn battles and keeping towers alive. When he joins fights himself, he does not hesitate to infect the enemies with Leech Seed, a spell that drains health from a targeted enemy and spreads it to nearby allies while slowing the foe. This makes it an ideal tool to ensure successful ganks early on and keep the team alive in the lategame. If he wants to initiate a bigger teamfight, he can prepare his whole team with Nature's Guise, a low-cooldown ability that allows him to render his team invisible one-by-one as long as they remain near trees. Since Rooftrellen himself stays invisible even when he casts spells, he can also stay in fights and help his team when he is low on health. Last but not least, his ultimate is Overgrowth. It enables him to root enemies in place in a huge area around him, disabling both movement and their attacks for several seconds. With nothing but their spells left to defend, they are at the mercy of the Treant Protector's team.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>A treant of immense age and wisdom, Rooftrellen was merely a sapling during the invasion of the Burning Legion. Having grown powerful over thousands of years, Rooftrellen has lent his considerable might to the Sentinel cause. An omnipresent force in the forest, he is capable using his power over the forest to hide his allies. Rooftrellen is aided by the forest itself, providing him with a thick living armor of vines and entangling nearby foes in a deadly embrace, allowing Rooftrellen to pound his victims to dust with his massive gnarled limbs.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>If you need someone to support a single ally, there's no one better at doing that than Io, the Wisp. Tether is the core skill of this hero. It links him to an ally, increasing the movespeed of both his ally and himself and slowing anyone who touches the link, making it a perfect ganking tool. Since Io pulls himself to the tethered ally if the distance is high enough, it also doubles as a great escape skill. Besides, the skill is also useful after ganks, because it allows Wisp to transfer any regeneration he receives to his ally as well. With Spirits, Wisp has a long ranged damage skill that also serves the purpose of giving vision of enemies it hits. Overcharge's utility lies in its combo with Tether. At the cost of a percentage of Wisp's current HP and MP, it gives Wisp and his tethered ally increased attack speed and reduces the damage they receive, which effectively allows carries to do their job earlier in the game. But his true power lies in the synergy between Tether and his ultimate, Relocate. These two skills can turn any ally into a global ganking machine. Io and the tethered ally can teleport anywhere on the map for a short time. This is why Io is the only true global ganking support and it makes him very effective with allied carries that have killing power in the early-mid-game.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Originally nothing more than a lowly spirit of the trees, Io dwelt peacefully amongst his kind in the Great Forest. As the Great War spread across the land the creatures of the forest were forced to defend their home. The desire to protect his kin awoke power in Io he had not known he possessed. He discovered he was able to connect his life force to another creature to strengthen them or help them flee by instantly transporting them out of harm. Io became known amongst his people as the Guardian Wisp, a protector of the Spirits. All other spirits swore to assist him and can be summoned to his side to aid him in his battle. Uninterested in the battle between the Sentinel and the Scourge, Io fights only to protect his people.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Alchemist is a difficult foe to handle, but if left to his own devices he can amass enormous amounts of gold at an alarming rate. His Acid Spray covers a large area with toxic chemicals, which deal physical damage and reduce the armor of any foe caught in the cloud. Attempting to fight the Alchemist while in an acid cloud is foolhardy at best, especially if he uses his Chemical Rage transformation skill. Chemical Rage drastically increases the life regeneration, and attack speed of the Alchemist, transforming him into a deadly fighter. Possibly his most dangerous skill, however, is Unstable Concoction. Although it takes some time to charge, Unstable Concoction results in one of the longest stuns in the game and causes a good deal of damage. Although the Alchemist can be annoying to fight, it's best to keep a close eye on him. Goblin's Greed directly increases the amount of gold the Alchemist gains when killing creeps, and as he kills more the bonus increases. Unless kept in check, this Goblin/Ogre combo can cause a lot of mayhem late in the game.</p>

Both sadistic and cruel in his methods, this heartless Goblin cares not what means he must resort to for a sizable bounty. Whether he chooses to paralyze his foes with toxic concoctions or drench them in corrosive acids, Razzil Darkbrew remains steadfast in his calm, calculated approach, despite their constant wails of agony.</p>

                    <p>A robotic terror, the Clockwerk Goblin is one of the most deadly ambush heroes in the game. Enemies who aren't careful will soon find themselves trapped and shredded by this tiny mechanical Goblin. The Clockwerk Goblin is at his most dangerous when he is right on top of his target. Using Battery Assault, he repeatedly damages and stuns an adjacent foe, and with proper positioning his Power Cogs can trap a single enemy nest to him, pushing others away. This combo is quite lethal to fragile heroes. To aid in finding and getting next to enemies, the Clockwerk Goblin has Rocket Flare and Hookshot. Rocket Flare sends a missile to anywhere on the battlefield, causing some damage and giving the Clockwerk Goblin vision of the targeted area for several seconds. Hookshot fires a chain which latches onto enemy units, causing damage and a stun. However, the primary purpose of Hookshot is to pull the Clockwerk Goblin to the target, putting him in perfect position to unleash his deadly Battery Assault and Power Cog combo. Good awareness is the best counter to this deceptively small mecha-Goblin.</p>

                    <p>Knight Davion is a powerful warrior who calls upon his draconic heritage to augment his already fearsome combat abilities. He has two powerful offensive skills: Dragon Tail and Breathe Fire. Dragon Tail allows him to stun a single enemy target for several seconds, and Breathe Fire taps into his inner dragon to unleash a powerful area of effect attack. This potent offense is supported by Davion's Dragon Blood passive skill, which makes him extremely difficult to kill by boosting his armor and hit point regeneration significantly. Combined together, these abilities make the Dragon Knight a tough, versatile fighter. At higher levels, the Dragon Knight gains the ability to transform completely into dragon form. The abilities and strength of the dragon form increase with levels. At maximum level, Davion transforms into a mighty blue dragon with an area of effect cold attack, which drastically slows all enemies caught in the freezing blasts. Along with his natural combat skills and toughness, this makes him an extremely dangerous foe.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Huskar is unique in being an aggressive strength hero with a regular ranged physical attack, giving him the advantages of a ranged hero and the survivability of a strength hero. Although he is a powerful force at all stages, Huskar is especially dangerous early in the game when his Burning Spears can quickly decimate any foe. Huskar can find his life quickly drained away by this ability, and must be careful to balance harassment and defense. Due to his Berserker's Blood passive, Huskar is at his most deadly when he is injured: as he gets more and more damaged, he gains attack speed and increased magic resistance. Combined with his Inner Vitality healing spell, Berserker's Blood can quickly turn what may have appeared to be a losing situation into a resounding victory. His powerful Life Break ability emphasizes this suicidal fighting style, causing immense damage to both the target and Huskar himself. However, while Huskar increases in power the more damage he takes, it is unlikely that his unlucky target can say the same.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>The Trolls of the Darkspear tribe, long since exiled from their ancestral lands in Stranglethorn Vale, are considered by many to be the most savage race of creatures to ever grace the battlefield. This reputation is well earned by their Sentinel representative Huskar, who's abilities revolve around shortening his own lifespan to spear his foes to burning pieces. Considered a blessed martyr by his people, the Sacred Warrior is not afraid of death, and will even run towards it willingly, sometimes desperately, in order to bring the Undead Scourge to an end.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Although his spells seem very weak at first glance, Rigwarl is a bad hero to underestimate. Quill Spray, Viscous Nasal Goo, and Warpath all provide relatively small effects when used only once, but each ability stacks when cast multiple times. Enemies of the Bristleback will soon find themselves covered in goo and shredded by constant quill fire if they aren't careful. Quill Spray deals increasing damage with each cast on the same target, and due to its low cooldown and mana cost it can be very deadly over time. When Rigwarl sees that his enemies are sufficiently weakened, he can move in for the kill with Viscous Nasal Goo. This ability slows the target and reduces their armor, increasing the damage of Quill Spray and Bristleback's physical attack and making it impossible to escape. Furthermore, casting spells puts Bristleback on the Warpath, which increases his movement and attack speeds as he uses his abilities. Bristleback's signature skill, and where he gets his name, is his near invulnerability to attacks that strike his back. All attacks and spells that come from behind him will be heavily reduced and cause additional Quill Sprays. Engaging a strong Rigwarl who is facing away is almost always a pointless exercise.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>The quillboars were never interested in the affairs and wars of other races, but one knew that the Scourge would eventually descend on their lands if left unchecked. Entering the ranks of the Sentinel for the sole reason of the preservation of his tribe, Rigwarl brings primal instincts to the never ending battle. Each time he releases a flurry of quills or a glob of slime, he works himself into a frenzy that increases his effectiveness drastically, and should he be in danger, his bristle back would shield him from further harm. A perfect demonstration of the abilities that even lesser beings can unleash.</p>

Your lazorbeam can be used on allies to heal them or on enemies to burn away their life while also slowing them. Your ultimate deals massive AoE damage but you won't be able to attack. At the end of your ultimate your hero will return with full health and mana to fight once more.</p>

                    <p>Ancient scriptures spoke of seven sacred emanations of light, and of their convergence in great conflict. The collision of these rays upon the mortal realm created a pyre of the highest purity, giving birth to the mythical Phoenix. As a manifestation of divine flames, Icarus can discharge either flames of death and destruction, or of life and healing. The concentrated beam of energy that he can emit can incinerate whole armies from across the battlefield. Unafraid to utilize his own life-force in order to vanquish his enemies, Icarus can also harness the direct power of the sun to create a stellar explosion.</p>

                    <p>The Tuskarr is a unique initiator that will not only jump on you by himself, but bring his nearby allies along with him. With his long-range initiation skills, his chasing abilities and a finishing move, he can easily bring havoc to frail enemies. Ice Shards is a long-range skillshot nuke that also creates impassable terrain in a circle behind the enemies. If used along with Snowball, this can trap enemies in between impassable terrain and Tuskarr and his allies. With Snowball, Tuskarr and nearby allied heroes can roll into an enemy hero, stunning and damaging everything in their way. This initiation move allows Tuskarr to overcome the enemies' positioning and get right into the backline onto the frail enemies. The Frozen Sigil provides a powerful slowing aura for teamfights and small skirmishes. Last but not least, Walrus Punch makes sure that the enemy initiated upon will not make it out alive. It deals critical damage, which is higher if the enemy's HP is low, disables the enemy and slows them afterwards, drastically reducing their chances to survive.</p>

                    <p>Hailing from the Borean Tundra, Ymir is one of the wisest Tuskarr warriors. Acquainted with years of warfare experience against raiding Ice Trolls and Nerubian Spiders that beset his village during his younger years, Ymir eagerly volunteered himself into the ranks of the Sentinel to help halt the notorious rise of the Lich King. A specialist in controlling the element of ice, Ymir's prowess lies in surprising enemies with frosty magics. His arsenal not only consists of propelling Snowballs and hurling shards of solidifying ice, but also conjuring massive Snowstorms that greatly impede his enemies' battle efficiency.</p>

                    <p>Simply put, Rizzrak is a tank ganker. Timber Chain is a 4 second pseudo-Blink with 1400 range and 200 pure damage in a line, combo'ed with Whirl Death immediately after means a 450 damage nuke every 8 seconds. Chakram provides another nuke, again in pure damage, as well as a slow effect for anyone silly enough to be in its way. Note that you will be unable to attack while your Ultimate is active, but Shredder's damage doesn't come from physical attacks anyway.

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Deep in the Forgotten Forests there is money to be made. No one knows this, and the dangers that lie within better than the goblin inventor Rizzrak. Combining heavy onboard weapons with the ability to clear an entire field of timber with ease, Rizzrak created a machine that’s as deadly as it is economical. With a detachable saw, brush clearing blades, and a tree grabbing chain Rizzrak is as threatening to his enemies as he is to a fresh sapling. Rizzrak's may not be a noble spirit, but the Sentinels money is as good as any, as long as he keeps his grubbing hands off the Tree of Life!</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>When the blight of the Scourge threatened the isolated peak villages of the Crag Lands, their pleas for aid went unanswered. The strong villagers climbing ever higher up the mountains to seek refuge, leaving those too young or old to their fates. When the forces of evil fed upon the helpless, their innocent blood wet the stones of the foothills. Seeing this, the heart of the mountains wept, and forged it's own champion to face off against the teeming hordes. Hewed from the cliff face, Kaolin was born into our world. Wielding the strength of the mountain, he bends stone and metal to his fierce will.</p>
