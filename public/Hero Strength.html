                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Daelin Proudmoore is a fearsome opponent in nearly any situation. His passive ability, Tidebringer, causes his sword to splash out massive damage over an area when he attacks, making him not only a constant threat in the lane, but a excellent damage dealer later in the game. Through the deadly combination of X Marks the Spot and Torrent, he can also pick off his fleeing enemies at will. He's not at a loss in large team clashes either; His ultimate summons the legendary ship S.S. CoCo, which empowers his allies with rum and crashes into enemies, causing massive devastation. This ruthless admiral leaves none alive, least not dry!</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Of all the allies in the Sentinel's ranks, only one, is known by as many names and is feared in as many lands. Called Capt. CoCo by his mates, Jacksparrow by others, The Legendary Mariner by some, but only a select few know his real name and what it stands for. He can harness the powers of the depths to conjure torrential geysers that blast his enemies into the air. His elegant blade is sworn to the Seas and with each mighty swing it ebbs like the tides. Using a watery form of spacial magic, he can bring you back to your original destination. The Captain now sails towards the Scourge lands, aboard his Phantom vessel boosting the spirits of his comrades with his fabled Rum, paving the way for the victory of the Sentinel. He is Kunkka, Master and Commander of the seven seas.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Beastmaster is a very well-rounded fighter, with many tactical options available for all types of combat. Although his physical attacks are melee, he can throw his axes at long range to slice through enemies, dealing lethal damage. His Primal Roar can turn the most organized defense into chaos, allowing the Beastmaster and his allies to move in for the kill. His summoning skills serve as effective support for his blitz-style combat. Rexxar's agile Hawk flies above the battlefield scouting for enemies, and the powerful slowing abilities of his Quillbeast's spines give him time to finish off fleeing foes. A skilled Beastmaster is a deadly foe, capable of fighting any enemy on any terms and crushing them to a pulp.</p>

                    <p>A wandering vagrant of the Mok'nathal, the fabled half orc-half ogres of legend, Rexxar and his mighty blades have joined the cause of the Sentinel to better protect the natural world around him. A friend of beasts, Rexxar flails and tears at his enemies with unsettling savagery, even going as far as hurling his axes in the manner of boomerangs at his enemies to better his chances at victory. Truly a warrior of the living planet that thrives around him, the Beastmaster is an ally to be counted on when he is needed the most.</p>

                    <p>The Centaur Warchief's toughness and survivability are legendary. The best place for this tank of a hero is in the center of combat, where his close range skills and massive vitality can be put to use. The Warchief's Hoof Stomp can incapacitate any enemies foolish enough to go toe-to-toe with him for several crucial seconds, giving the Warchief and his allies time to finish them off. The Warchief can also deliver a single lethal blow at the cost of some of his own life with Double Edge. In addition, the Warchief's passive Return skill deals damage to attackers, making bringing this beast down a difficult and risky proposition at best. His charismatic leadership can rally ally forces to race across the toughest terrains, leaving his trampled enemies sluggish in its wake.</p>

                    <p>Gifted with a tremendous body and an ever-growing fortitude, Bradwarden's courage is only matched by the size of his heart. Prophesied as a savior by the oracles of his tribe, Bradwarden is the living token of the allegiance of the centaurs to the Sentinel. He swings his axe with massive force, sometimes even hurting himself when doing so. The ground trembles every time he slams his hoof and his reflexes are impossible to surpass; allowing him to retaliate just after being attacked. Bradwarden is decided to fulfill his destiny, and he knows that the upcoming battle will become his ultimate challenge.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Although the Earthshaker is a strength hero, his real power lies in his spells. With a well-placed Echo Slam, Raigor can single-handedly level an entire team of enemies if they are foolish enough to bunch together. His Fissure spell is very versatile. While it deals decent damage along with a stun, it also creates an impassible wall of rock for several seconds. A skilled Earthshaker can use this to his advantage, blocking enemy movement and trapping hapless foes between a rock and a hard place. Enchant Totem gives him a significant damage boost for one attack, and his passive Aftershock ability causes a minor stun and damage effect under him every time he casts one of his spells. Although he is one of the more difficult heroes to use to his full strength, he is also one of the most deadly heroes in skilled hands.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>In the barren-lands, tales spoke of tauren sages reaping the essence of dirt. Their consciousness melds with the brown beneath them. The loam becomes the conduit of their mental thought and reality. These warriors were feared for they could summon massive ruptures at their mere whim. So tremendous was their power that their magic leaks out of the earth violently with every spell. Sadly these sages mysteriously faded from the land. When the World Tree was threatened, couriers searched for these mighty ones but found just one. A young adept, Raigor Stonehoof, seeks battle to weave new tales of these shamans.</p>

                    <p>A noble hero through and through, the Omniknight uses his powerful support and healing abilities to turn the tide of battle. Purification, a direct healing spell, instantly heals a large portion of the targets life. However, it doubles as a powerful offensive ability, dealing massive damage to all foes surrounding the target being healed. Repel allows the Omniknight to make a target ally immune to most spells for an extended period of time, although it makes them unable to be targeted by Purification. Enemies who try to escape Purist's holy wrath will find it difficult to flee from his Degeneration Aura, which passively slows the movement of all nearby foes. Finally, his Guardian Angel can single-handedly turn the tide of any battle. This powerful protective spell grants all allies within range near-invulnerability to physical damage, as well as rapid healing. His peerless support skills in the heat of battle make the Omniknight an invaluable member of any team.</p>

                    <p>A former member of the Order of the Silver Hand, Purist has joined the Sentinel to avenge the death of the Order's leader, Uther the Lightbringer. Trained by Uther himself in the ways of the Paladin, Purist brings the power of the Holy Light to the battlefield. He can purify the souls of allies, harming any nearby Scourge in the process. Able to protect allies from harmful unholy magic, the mere presence of a man of the Holy Light atrophies any nearby enemies. In times of dire need, Purist can call upon God himself to protect him and his allies.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Brewmaster uses the ancient art of drunken fighting to bash his enemies to a bloody pulp while surviving even the most deadly attacks with ease. Thunder Clap deals a lot of damage to nearby enemies while slowing them significantly, giving the Brewmaster time to bash their skulls in with his drunken brawling skills. If an enemy seems too dangerous the Brewmaster douses them with Drunken Haze, which causes the majority of the target's physical attacks to miss their mark. Heroes who rely on physical attacks will find the Brewmaster nearly impossible to damage when he uses Drunken Haze and Drunken Brawler. In addition, even if the Brewmaster does seem to be in danger, he can split into three powerful elemental aspects with Primal Split. Each individual elemental panda is a dangerous fighter with their own unique abilities. The Brewmaster is a difficult enemy to defeat, and should be engaged only with overwhelming force.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Mangix originates from a deeply hidden and secret society located on the obscure island of Pandaria. He lived a sheltered life in his home within the Stonetalon Mountains, but even the far, golden reaches of Pandaria were affected by the dark hand of the Scourge. The elders heard the cries of the innocent, and saw the blood of the slain, and so, they agreed to send one elite warrior, hoping to turn the tides of battle and restore the Great Balance. What they did not know was that the local barkeep had trained for this very moment his entire life.</p>

                    <p>Sven is all about getting pumped up. His skills allow him to deal a lot of area of effect damage to several targets at once. Storm Bolt is a powerful damage spell, which stuns both the target and all surrounding units for several seconds, allowing Sven to catch up and deal with them. His Warcry ability helps, giving Sven and nearby allies a temporary movement speed and armor bonus so they can charge quickly and fearlessly. Sven's foes should be especially fearful of his powerful physical attacks. God's Strength pumps Sven's damage up to very high levels, and Cleave turns every attack into an area of effect strike. Although his gameplay is fairly straightforward, Sven should not be underestimated. The best course of action when faced with a fully pumped Sven is to run.</p>

                    <p>Although his name seems fitting at first, over time Tiny the Stone Giant will grow both in size and strength. His immense strength allows him to grab the closest enemy and toss them through the air towards a target unit. Combining this with Tiny's Avalanche spell gives him incredible area of effect damage. However, Tiny is also extremely dangerous in one on one situations. With proper timing Tiny can Toss an enemy who is taking damage from Avalanche, and if the target lands back in the Avalanche they will take double damage. This is often enough to instantly kill more fragile heroes, although tougher heroes should be wary of engaging the Stone Giant as well. Tiny's Craggy Exterior can occasionally stun close range attackers, giving him time to escape or punish them with his crushing blows. If possible, it's best to keep this mobile mountain at arm's length.</p>

With his supreme strength, he is able to launch anything into the air, including huge amounts of soil to cause avalanches around his enemies. Because of his craggy exterior, enemies have a hard time attacking him. Over time, Tiny's body will grow bigger as the magnetic forces deep inside his granite heart pull rocks and soil to his rugged stone form.</p>

                    <p>The Tauren Chieftain is a strong physical damage dealer who can disable and destroy many heroes at once with his spells. Most of the Chieftain's abilities revolve around the guardian spirit which aids him in battle. Using Ancestral Spirit, Cairne can temporarily separate the guardian spirit from himself. While the spirit is separate, it causes damage to enemies it strikes and mimics the Chieftain's movement and Echo Stomp ability. When the spirit and Cairne rejoin, he gains a boost to his physical damage and move speed, the strength of which depends on how many enemies the spirit collided with. This makes him a very dangerous physical attacker, especially combined with his offensive aura, Natural Order. This ability reduces the base armor and magic resistance of all nearby units, giving the Chieftain's attacks and spells a significant boost to their damage. His final ability is called Earth Splitter, a powerful area of effect spell which can cause severe damage and disable many enemies at once. Since it takes a few seconds to have any effect and is easy to dodge on its own, it's best to combo this ability with either Echo Stomp or allied disabling spells. However, if multiple enemy heroes are hit by this ability, it generally spells their doom.</p>

                    <p>Since ancient times it has been prophesized by the Tauren elders that a Chieftain will come, strong as the mightiest warriors and wise as the eldest shamans. After many years of wandering the sacred lands, seeking wisdom from his forefathers, Cairne Bloodhoof has proven himself as the long awaited hero. Cairne carries with him the spirit of his mightiest ancestor, and now the ground shakes with the combined strength of the Chieftain and his guardian spirit. No physical nor magical barrier can reduce the power of his enchanted halberd, the weapon used by his guardian in ancient times. Such is the power of this axe that it can split the very earth itself. Seeking revenge for the ravaging of his homeland, Cairne will soon bring his wrath upon the Scourge.</p>

                    <p>Seemingly slow and cumbrous in battle, the Treant Protector is a supporter who can help other lanes win without being near while being a powerful and durable supporter in larger fights, increasing the life expectancy of his team significantly. His most prominent ability is Living Armor, a protective skill he can cast globally that heals an allied unit and grants a few protective layers that can block any form of damage. It also works on buildings, so it doubles as a mighty tool for saving allies from forlorn battles and keeping towers alive. When he joins fights himself, he does not hesitate to infect the enemies with Leech Seed, a spell that drains health from a targeted enemy and spreads it to nearby allies while slowing the foe. This makes it an ideal tool to ensure successful ganks early on and keep the team alive in the lategame. If he wants to initiate a bigger teamfight, he can prepare his whole team with Nature's Guise, a low-cooldown ability that allows him to render his team invisible one-by-one as long as they remain near trees. Since Rooftrellen himself stays invisible even when he casts spells, he can also stay in fights and help his team when he is low on health. Last but not least, his ultimate is Overgrowth. It enables him to root enemies in place in a huge area around him, disabling both movement and their attacks for several seconds. With nothing but their spells left to defend, they are at the mercy of the Treant Protector's team.</p>

An omnipresent force in the forest, he is capable using his power over the forest to hide his allies. Rooftrellen is aided by the forest itself, providing him with a thick living armor of vines and entangling nearby foes in a deadly embrace, allowing Rooftrellen to pound his victims to dust with his massive gnarled limbs.</p>

                    <p>If you need someone to support a single ally, there's no one better at doing that than Io, the Wisp. Tether is the core skill of this hero. It links him to an ally, increasing the movespeed of both his ally and himself and slowing anyone who touches the link, making it a perfect ganking tool. Since Io pulls himself to the tethered ally if the distance is high enough, it also doubles as a great escape skill. Besides, the skill is also useful after ganks, because it allows Wisp to transfer any regeneration he receives to his ally as well. With Spirits, Wisp has a long ranged damage skill that also serves the purpose of giving vision of enemies it hits. Overcharge's utility lies in its combo with Tether. At the cost of a percentage of Wisp's current HP and MP, it gives Wisp and his tethered ally increased attack speed and reduces the damage they receive, which effectively allows carries to do their job earlier in the game. But his true power lies in the synergy between Tether and his ultimate, Relocate. These two skills can turn any ally into a global ganking machine. Io and the tethered ally can teleport anywhere on the map for a short time. This is why Io is the only true global ganking support and it makes him very effective with allied carries that have killing power in the early-mid-game.</p>

As the Great War spread across the land the creatures of the forest were forced to defend their home. The desire to protect his kin awoke power in Io he had not known he possessed. He discovered he was able to connect his life force to another creature to strengthen them or help them flee by instantly transporting them out of harm. Io became known amongst his people as the Guardian Wisp, a protector of the Spirits. All other spirits swore to assist him and can be summoned to his side to aid him in his battle. Uninterested in the battle between the Sentinel and the Scourge, Io fights only to protect his people.</p>

                    <p>The Alchemist is a difficult foe to handle, but if left to his own devices he can amass enormous amounts of gold at an alarming rate. His Acid Spray covers a large area with toxic chemicals, which deal physical damage and reduce the armor of any foe caught in the cloud. Attempting to fight the Alchemist while in an acid cloud is foolhardy at best, especially if he uses his Chemical Rage transformation skill. Chemical Rage drastically increases the life regeneration, and attack speed of the Alchemist, transforming him into a deadly fighter. Possibly his most dangerous skill, however, is Unstable Concoction. Although it takes some time to charge, Unstable Concoction results in one of the longest stuns in the game and causes a good deal of damage. Although the Alchemist can be annoying to fight, it's best to keep a close eye on him. Goblin's Greed directly increases the amount of gold the Alchemist gains when killing creeps, and as he kills more the bonus increases. Unless kept in check, this Goblin/Ogre combo can cause a lot of mayhem late in the game.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>A robotic terror, the Clockwerk Goblin is one of the most deadly ambush heroes in the game. Enemies who aren't careful will soon find themselves trapped and shredded by this tiny mechanical Goblin. The Clockwerk Goblin is at his most dangerous when he is right on top of his target. Using Battery Assault, he repeatedly damages and stuns an adjacent foe, and with proper positioning his Power Cogs can trap a single enemy nest to him, pushing others away. This combo is quite lethal to fragile heroes. To aid in finding and getting next to enemies, the Clockwerk Goblin has Rocket Flare and Hookshot. Rocket Flare sends a missile to anywhere on the battlefield, causing some damage and giving the Clockwerk Goblin vision of the targeted area for several seconds. Hookshot fires a chain which latches onto enemy units, causing damage and a stun. However, the primary purpose of Hookshot is to pull the Clockwerk Goblin to the target, putting him in perfect position to unleash his deadly Battery Assault and Power Cog combo. Good awareness is the best counter to this deceptively small mecha-Goblin.</p>

                    <p>The by-product of Goblin technological weapon research during the old War, Rattletrap the Clockwerk Goblin was shut away into storage for countless decades until the Sentinel found and reactivated him. Combat-wise, this goblin's capabilities know few bounds; his body is stocked with a huge array of armaments that destroy targets both near and far with ease. His trademark wrench can even extend itself like a grappling hook, allowing him to pick off individual targets with pin-point accuracy.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Knight Davion is a powerful warrior who calls upon his draconic heritage to augment his already fearsome combat abilities. He has two powerful offensive skills: Dragon Tail and Breathe Fire. Dragon Tail allows him to stun a single enemy target for several seconds, and Breathe Fire taps into his inner dragon to unleash a powerful area of effect attack. This potent offense is supported by Davion's Dragon Blood passive skill, which makes him extremely difficult to kill by boosting his armor and hit point regeneration significantly. Combined together, these abilities make the Dragon Knight a tough, versatile fighter. At higher levels, the Dragon Knight gains the ability to transform completely into dragon form. The abilities and strength of the dragon form increase with levels. At maximum level, Davion transforms into a mighty blue dragon with an area of effect cold attack, which drastically slows all enemies caught in the freezing blasts. Along with his natural combat skills and toughness, this makes him an extremely dangerous foe.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Abandoned and forsaken as a child, the Half-bred Dragon Davion sought refuge from the evils of the world, and from the uncontrollable power growing within himself. His search led him to the doorstep of a mighty Druid, who taught him to tap into the massive energies that lay concealed in his blood - a tribute to his ancient Draconian heritage. A master swordsman, Davion smites his foes in his raging frenzy - transforming at will into an Elder Dragon of destructive fiery rage to crush all those that threaten to vanquish his new home.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Huskar is unique in being an aggressive strength hero with a regular ranged physical attack, giving him the advantages of a ranged hero and the survivability of a strength hero. Although he is a powerful force at all stages, Huskar is especially dangerous early in the game when his Burning Spears can quickly decimate any foe. Huskar can find his life quickly drained away by this ability, and must be careful to balance harassment and defense. Due to his Berserker's Blood passive, Huskar is at his most deadly when he is injured: as he gets more and more damaged, he gains attack speed and increased magic resistance. Combined with his Inner Vitality healing spell, Berserker's Blood can quickly turn what may have appeared to be a losing situation into a resounding victory. His powerful Life Break ability emphasizes this suicidal fighting style, causing immense damage to both the target and Huskar himself. However, while Huskar increases in power the more damage he takes, it is unlikely that his unlucky target can say the same.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>The Trolls of the Darkspear tribe, long since exiled from their ancestral lands in Stranglethorn Vale, are considered by many to be the most savage race of creatures to ever grace the battlefield. This reputation is well earned by their Sentinel representative Huskar, who's abilities revolve around shortening his own lifespan to spear his foes to burning pieces. Considered a blessed martyr by his people, the Sacred Warrior is not afraid of death, and will even run towards it willingly, sometimes desperately, in order to bring the Undead Scourge to an end.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Although his spells seem very weak at first glance, Rigwarl is a bad hero to underestimate. Quill Spray, Viscous Nasal Goo, and Warpath all provide relatively small effects when used only once, but each ability stacks when cast multiple times. Enemies of the Bristleback will soon find themselves covered in goo and shredded by constant quill fire if they aren't careful. Quill Spray deals increasing damage with each cast on the same target, and due to its low cooldown and mana cost it can be very deadly over time. When Rigwarl sees that his enemies are sufficiently weakened, he can move in for the kill with Viscous Nasal Goo. This ability slows the target and reduces their armor, increasing the damage of Quill Spray and Bristleback's physical attack and making it impossible to escape. Furthermore, casting spells puts Bristleback on the Warpath, which increases his movement and attack speeds as he uses his abilities. Bristleback's signature skill, and where he gets his name, is his near invulnerability to attacks that strike his back. All attacks and spells that come from behind him will be heavily reduced and cause additional Quill Sprays. Engaging a strong Rigwarl who is facing away is almost always a pointless exercise.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>The quillboars were never interested in the affairs and wars of other races, but one knew that the Scourge would eventually descend on their lands if left unchecked. Entering the ranks of the Sentinel for the sole reason of the preservation of his tribe, Rigwarl brings primal instincts to the never ending battle. Each time he releases a flurry of quills or a glob of slime, he works himself into a frenzy that increases his effectiveness drastically, and should he be in danger, his bristle back would shield him from further harm. A perfect demonstration of the abilities that even lesser beings can unleash.</p>

The collision of these rays upon the mortal realm created a pyre of the highest purity, giving birth to the mythical Phoenix. As a manifestation of divine flames, Icarus can discharge either flames of death and destruction, or of life and healing. The concentrated beam of energy that he can emit can incinerate whole armies from across the battlefield. Unafraid to utilize his own life-force in order to vanquish his enemies, Icarus can also harness the direct power of the sun to create a stellar explosion.</p>

                    <p>The Tuskarr is a unique initiator that will not only jump on you by himself, but bring his nearby allies along with him. With his long-range initiation skills, his chasing abilities and a finishing move, he can easily bring havoc to frail enemies. Ice Shards is a long-range skillshot nuke that also creates impassable terrain in a circle behind the enemies. If used along with Snowball, this can trap enemies in between impassable terrain and Tuskarr and his allies. With Snowball, Tuskarr and nearby allied heroes can roll into an enemy hero, stunning and damaging everything in their way. This initiation move allows Tuskarr to overcome the enemies' positioning and get right into the backline onto the frail enemies. The Frozen Sigil provides a powerful slowing aura for teamfights and small skirmishes. Last but not least, Walrus Punch makes sure that the enemy initiated upon will not make it out alive. It deals critical damage, which is higher if the enemy's HP is low, disables the enemy and slows them afterwards, drastically reducing their chances to survive.</p>

A specialist in controlling the element of ice, Ymir's prowess lies in surprising enemies with frosty magics. His arsenal not only consists of propelling Snowballs and hurling shards of solidifying ice, but also conjuring massive Snowstorms that greatly impede his enemies' battle efficiency.</p>

I didn’t become the greatest general this kingdom has seen in hundreds of years to see my lands reduced to this, but that will be dealt with shortly. For now my axe is called to battle the hordes of darkness that threaten every human in these lands. I march to turn the tables on these horrors, and I dare even one of them to test me in single combat! I go to see things are taken care of the right way, the human way!</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>Simply put, Rizzrak is a tank ganker. Timber Chain is a 4 second pseudo-Blink with 1400 range and 200 pure damage in a line, combo'ed with Whirl Death immediately after means a 450 damage nuke every 8 seconds. Chakram provides another nuke, again in pure damage, as well as a slow effect for anyone silly enough to be in its way. Note that you will be unable to attack while your Ultimate is active, but Shredder's damage doesn't come from physical attacks anyway. Rizzrak has 3 active skills with low cooldown, players wanting to try out Rizzrak should concentrate on upgrading mana pool, mana regen, and HP pool.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Deep in the Forgotten Forests there is money to be made. No one knows this, and the dangers that lie within better than the goblin inventor Rizzrak. Combining heavy onboard weapons with the ability to clear an entire field of timber with ease, Rizzrak created a machine that’s as deadly as it is economical. With a detachable saw, brush clearing blades, and a tree grabbing chain Rizzrak is as threatening to his enemies as he is to a fresh sapling. Rizzrak's may not be a noble spirit, but the Sentinels money is as good as any, as long as he keeps his grubbing hands off the Tree of Life!</p>

                    <p>When the blight of the Scourge threatened the isolated peak villages of the Crag Lands, their pleas for aid went unanswered. The strong villagers climbing ever higher up the mountains to seek refuge, leaving those too young or old to their fates. When the forces of evil fed upon the helpless, their innocent blood wet the stones of the foothills. Seeing this, the heart of the mountains wept, and forged it's own champion to face off against the teeming hordes. Hewed from the cliff face, Kaolin was born into our world. Wielding the strength of the mountain, he bends stone and metal to his fierce will.</p>

His Battle Hunger gives enemies the choice between staying back and taking damage, or engaging in battle and risking being trapped by Berserker's Call. The extremely effective combination of Berserker's Call and Counter Helix can cause massive amounts of damage to a large group of enemies, while allowing his allies free reign. If an enemy should manage to escape his Call, Mogul Khan can abruptly end their life with his mighty Culling Blade. Truly, the Axe is an enemy to be feared, lest his opponents taste his blade!</p>

One such warrior was the leader of the Half-Tribe of the Bloodied Axe Clan; Mogul Kahn. Mogul was slain by human Paladins but mysteriously was seen fighting alongside the Scourge around the time Mannoroth started to command the Orcs in the war against Archimonde. The Axe has been revived by demons and uses his reflexes and powerful blows to hunt down and seek out the Sentinels' agile warriors and cut them down to size, even projecting his lust for war onto them.</p>

                    <p>The Chaos Knight has one of the highest damage potentials among strength heroes. He is capable of dealing out a lot of punishment with his powerful critical hits and illusions. In addition, he offers good mobility and a strong stun. Chaos Bolt, as indicated by its name, is a strong but random ability. It deals a random amount of damage over a set range, and stuns the target for a variable length of time based on the level of the skill. It can either be very effective or mediocre, depending on the Chaos Knight's luck. Similarly, his critical strike has a fairly low chance of activating, but the damage payoff is the highest of any non-ultimate critical hit. The Chaos Knight is quite mobile for a strength hero. His Reality Rift instantly teleports you, any images you have and the target unit to a random point along the line between the two of you, while giving Chaos Knight a damage bonus.</p>

He uses his ability to call upon chaotic energy to damage and stun an enemy for a random length of time in conjunction with his power to rip holes in space to instantly strike down all that stand against him. His powers culminate into the terrifying Phantasm, creating avatars of himself who do full damage to all those who oppose him, confusing the battlefield and wreaking havoc amongst the forces of Good.</p>

                    <p>The mighty Doom Bringer is a versatile and dangerous foe. His offensive spells are very damaging. LVL? Death allows him to pick off heroes at range, and deals extra damage against heroes of certain levels. The dreaded Doom is one of the most feared spells in the game, and with good reason. Not only does it deal massive damage over time to its target, it also silences them completely for its duration. Although the Doom Bringer is no pushover in physical combat, he lacks any dedicated fighting abilities. Instead, he relies on Devour to feed his appetite for powerful items, and buffs his movement and attack speed with Scorched Earth. With his good income, strong damage spells, and the ability to effectively knock a single enemy hero out of a fight, the Doom Bringer is a formidable opponent in any matchup.</p>

With his original master long gone, Lucifer grants his undying loyalty to the Scourge to finish what his lord once started. Devouring the insignificant for his greed while dissipating the souls of those brave and strong enough to withstand his strength and the heat of his fiery haven of burning earth, Lucifer takes no prisoners and makes sure those who persevere through his wrath die by the agonizing and burning pain of Doom itself.

                    <p>A vicious and insidious creature, the Lifestealer is particularly good at tearing tough heroes down. Using his Feast passive skill, which deals damage and steals life based on the hit points of the target, he can serve as a powerful anti-tank hero. Open Wounds allows him to immobilize his prey and encourages allies to move in for the kill, giving life steal on all attacks against the target for a short period of time. It is likely enemies will try to stop the Lifestealer with spells of their own, but using his terrifying Rage skill he becomes temporarily magic immune and gains an attack speed bonus, giving him time to rip apart his enemies. Due to his up-close and personal fighting style, N'aix sometimes gets in over his head. If this happens, he can make use of his Infest ability. Infest allows the Lifestealer to burrow inside any non-hero unit, rendering him completely hidden from enemy eyes. When ready, N'aix can burst from his victim, stealing a large amount of their life and killing them instantly.</p>

Yet his body, so corrupted by his desire to steal, rose by itself in the form of a monstrous ghoul. So came into being N'aix, his old name long forgotten: the embodiment of lust and greed, bent on stealing the life of every living creature he encounters.

                    <p>There are few heroes who are more difficult to kill than the Lord of Avernus. Using his Aphotic Shield, Abaddon can cast barriers around any friendly unit which absorb a set amount of damage before exploding, dealing the absorbed damage back to nearby attackers. When under threat himself, Abaddon uses Borrowed Time, which can give him new life if he is in danger. For several seconds, Borrowed Time reverses the effect of all incoming damage and makes it heal Abaddon instead. Many enemies who were sure of their victory have fallen upon the Lord of Avernus intent on destroying him, only to find him completely healed by their attacks. In addition to his own near-invulnerability, Abaddon can heal allies with his Death Coil spell. At the cost of some of his own life, the Lord of Avernus can either heal an allied unit or damage a foe.</p>

                    <p>A former paladin of great renown, Abaddon fell into darkness during the invasion of the Burning Legion, becoming possessed by many demons, corrupting both his soul and his powers. Now a Death Knight set high in the Lich King's hierarchy of generals, he rides into battle against impossible odds, never stopping until he reaches the World Tree itself. Whether enhancing his own fortitude with a shield of dark energy, or using his life force to aid in combat, the Lord of Avernus leads the armies of the Scourge ever onward, forever locked in combat with the forces of good, and his enemies who were once his greatest comrades.</p>

                    <p>Banehallow the Lycanthrope focuses on sudden, swift attacks. He can often be found lurking the forest with his wolves, then suddenly bursting forth with a dread howl, chasing down and killing fragile enemy heroes. His wolf companions are deadly fighters, and are capable of dealing a lot of damage on their own. They are also excellent at helping the Lycanthrope kill neutral units, allowing him to get a lot of gold without letting enemy heroes know where he is. While hidden, the Lycanthrope can use his Howl ability, which infuses all allies across the map with extra damage. Feral Impulse grants sizable damage and attack speed bonuses to both Banehallow and his summons. When he deems the time is right, the Lycanthrope transforms into his wolf form with Shapeshift.</p>

                    <p>Banehallow is an avatar of bestial fury created by the scourge. For years he has dwelled in the dark forests of the world, hunting innocents that wander therein. Now he is called to aid his masters. He revels in blood and battle, using his wolfish persona to draw the feral beasts to his side and imbue his allies with his flesh-shredding strength. He is also unnaturally quick and agile. Some say he can even transform into a giant wolf, giving him more durability and the speed to gouge and maim with near impunity.</p>

Balanar's passive Hunter in the Night increases his movespeed and attackspeed at night making him a feared ganker and chaser. His Void spell damages the target and slows them to a crawl allowing Balanar and his allies to deal great amounts of damage when cast during nighttime. Crippling fear is a powerful weapon against spellcasters and fighters alike as it both silences and causes a large chance of missing on physical attacks for its duration. Balanar's ultimate "Darkness" allows him to instantly transform day into night (or prolong the night), providing for the fullest effect of his other spells. However, nobody fears the Nightstalker during the day...</p>

There's no chance to fight, no way to run, and no place to hide - darkness is everywhere! You can pray, you can cry, but the darkness won't be stopped - until you die.</p>

He can trap many foes at once, rain fire on them and make their bodies explode after. He's a deadly combination that satisfies the devil's love for fire and death, but he can also instantly transport every ally and himself to another battle field, making him a valuable leader of the undead, always present where he is needed.</p>

                    <p>One of the many regents of Lord Archimonde who became stranded on the physical plane after the Legion fell in Kalimdor, the devil Azgalor's love of destruction allowed him to accept the Lich King's invitation to help lead the Scourge in conquest with few regrets. After all, this Pit Lord is happiest when he conjures fire to scorch his opponents from above, roasting them slowly as the dead literally explode from beneath their feet. With such hateful power in the hands of a monster such as this, it's no wonder he inspires so much terror as he roams across the battlefield.

                    <p>Pudge the Butcher is one of the most difficult heroes to play effectively, but also one of the most rewarding. His Meat Hook skill is extremely deadly, but also difficult to utilize. A well placed Meat Hook will snag an enemy hero and drag them to the Butcher, dealing a lot of damage along the way. Once the target has been hooked, Pudge uses his other two active skills to finish them off. Rot is a toggled damage over time skill which affects all nearby enemies and also Pudge himself. Pudge must be careful when using this skill. Although it does a lot of damage it can quickly drain his life and make him easy prey for enemies. To stop his target from escaping or fighting back, Pudge can use his Dismember ability. This short range skill deals even more damage and completely immobilizes the target. When used in succession, these three skills make Pudge a dangerous assassin, although he may not look like it. To aid his risky gameplay, Pudge has a passive skill called Flesh Heap. Flesh Heap provides some magic resistance which reduces the damage he takes from rot, and gives him a minor permanent bonus to his strength every time he kills a unit.</p>

It is said his victims catch only a glimpse of his monstrous frame as they are dragged them through the shadows, bleeding profusely as a jagged hook etches deeper in their flesh. Wails of agony echo in the distance, only to be drowned out by the Butcher's maniacal laughter as he severs their limp bodies with his great maw. Unspeakable horrors ensue in a deathly silence, a dreadful omen for what is to come.</p>

Hellfire Blast is his one active spell, and it allows him to catch and kill enemies. Vampiric Aura and Critical Strike make him deadly in a straight fight; the Skeleton King hits hard and gains life with every attack. Even if Leoric seems to be destroyed, he is still not beaten. This is where his signature ability comes in: Reincarnation. As long as Reincarnation is ready and the Skeleton King has enough mana, he will revive where he fell after a few seconds at full strength. Reincarnation makes the Skeleton King very difficult to defeat, since you essentially have to kill him twice.</p>

Now, Lucifer has thrown him back onto the soil, corrupted and mindless, as King Leoric, the Skeleton King. He marches on, leading his minions with an unfaltering gaze, knowing only one thing: the orders given to him by the dark lord himself. Able to cripple his opponents by drawing power from the fiery depths of hell itself, King Leoric is a major threat on the battlefield. His mighty blade allows him and others in his presence to drain the blood of their enemies. It is said that he is unkillable, and those who are struck down by his hellfire don't wake up again.</p>

To get into close enough range to make use of his stun skills, Slardar uses Sprint.

To create more available souls, Dirge can make a Tombstone, which continually raises the dead from the ground to attack and slow enemies. And when he gets really angry, Dirge can transform into the hideous Flesh Golem, slowing and amplifying all damage to enemies around him and recovering HP whenever one of them dies. Though Dirge cannot rapidly take down single enemies, a large group without proper area control will find itself smothered by the stench and attacks of numerous living dead, unable to cope with the unstoppable destruction of the Undying.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Considered to be an exceptionally filthy and despicable specimen by all who encounter him, including his fellow zombies, Dirge has wandered in from the wastes outside to serve the Lich King in hopes of finally obtaining a place of acceptance amongst the Undead masses. While he is still considered to be unpleasant as ever by the rest of the Scourge, his horrifying abilities, which include raising lesser ghouls and spreading vile, rapidly communicable plague throughout the enemy ranks, are unquestionably powerful and may just give the Scourge the edge they need to complete their unholy conquest once and for all.</p>

                    <p>A massive sea monster of incredible strength and toughness, Leviathan is a real tank. Using his Gush skill, he can slow and damage a single target while reducing their armor, allow the Tidehunter and his allies to pummel the target to a pulp. To aid his close combat skills, the Leviathan has a powerful Anchor Smash passive skill, which gives him a chance to unleash a devastating area of effect spin with every attack. A target of Gush who is hit by an Anchor Smash or two is in deep trouble. To protect himself while chasing down and smashing enemies, Leviathan has a second passive: Kraken Shell. This ability reduces all damage from physical attacks by a set number, allowing the Leviathan to wade into combat without fear, ignoring the blows of lesser foes.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Formerly considered by the Old Gods as an oeuvre of the cosmos, Leviathan was thrown into the watery abyss after an alleged connivance with the Titans whom they have fought against. Chained to an anchor and guarded by a virtually indomitable kraken, the Tidehunter had lain dormant in the unfathomable depths for eons until he finally mustered enough strength to break away. He killed his enslaver, took its shell as armor and the once loathed anchor became his weapon. Unforgiving and frigid as the sea, Leviathan had sworn to disembowel everyone who would dare disturb his much valued freedom as he knocks them out with ravaging force. The terror of the tides had come at last and all those who will try to stop him shall be swept away.</p>

                	<h4>HERO INTRODUCTION</h4>
                    <p>The Magnataur's primary role is using his powerful Reverse Polarity ability to ensure his team's victory in battle. With proper placement, a single Reverse Polarity can change the outcome of a team battle and potentially win the game. If combined with other area of effect spells, Reverse Polarity can destroy an entire enemy team. However, Magnus himself is no pushover in combat. Using Empower and Mighty Swing in conjunction gives him a very strong physical attack capable of damaging multiple bunched up units, perfect when used after Reverse Polarity. In addition, Magnus has an area of effect spell of his own: Shockwave. Due to its relatively low mana cost and cooldown coupled with its high damage, Shockwave is an effective tool for harassing enemies in a lane and finishing off damaged foes. Although the power of Reverse Polarity tends to overshadow his other skills, Magnus is far from a one-skill hero.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>Maybe the most tremendous being on the Scourge, Magnus is a power to be reckoned with. Trained from birth to become a potent warrior, he is now at the peak of his strength. The Magnataur's giant axe can cleave paths through his enemies, and create a bone-breaking shockwave that ripples through the ground. Further strengthened by a demonic magic that enhances his attacks, he can crush enemies with shocking ease. His greatest power, though, is the ability to create an immensely strong magnetic field, sucking in helpless foes to meet their end.</p>

                    <p>True to his name, the Spiritbreaker is excellent at crushing the fight out of an enemy target. His skills are focused on disabling and killing a single enemy hero, making him much more effective in ambushes and one on one situations than large team battles. The Spiritbreaker generally opens with a Charge of Darkness, which allows him to charge from any point on the map towards the target, increasing in speed as he approaches his target. Upon arrival, he delivers a crushing stun, giving him time to follow up with his other active ability: Netherstrike. Netherstrike is a short range teleporting attack, which knocks the target back and deals massive damage.</p>

Found and recruited by the Lich King, Barathrum's uncanny speed and wraithlike powers have now been unleashed upon the Material Plane, his lantern able to project nether energy into enemies, sending them backwards with sudden force. With the ability to close the distance between himself and a target in seconds, Barathrum the Spiritbreaker is more than a match for anyone.</p>

                    <p>The Sand King emphasizes area of effect damage more than most. All four of his abilities can damage multiple foes at once. Burrowstrike, his mainstay, damages and stuns targets in a line. In addition, when using this ability, the Sand King burrows to the target location which sets him up for additional attacks or spells. This can get him into trouble though, and to help evade counter attacks Crixalis uses Sand Storm. While active, this ability makes the Sand King invisible in the middle of a swirling storm of dust. Although he is unable to move while remaining invisible, nearby enemies will take damage as long as they remain in the storm.</p>

                	<h4>BACKGROUND STORY</h4>
                    <p>A guardian of the ancient Nerubian Kingdom of Azjol-Nerub, Crixalis fled to the deserts of Kalimdor in an attempt to escape the genocide of the Lich King. The harsh climate transformed this warrior into a master of the earth, able to tear the skin off his foes with vicious sand storms. Those unfortunate to succumb to his potent toxins are condemned to violently burst apart in a cloud of noxious fumes. Sensing his growing power, the Lich King sought out Crixalis and, unable to sway him, slew him in battle. Summoned to aid the Undead Scourge, the heart of the Sentinel quivers each time the ground trembles beneath them.</p>
